Although multiple sclerosis \\ndoes not negatively influence most pregnancy outcomes, less is known regarding the effects of fetal exposure to novel \\ndisease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The withdrawal of some DMTs during pregnancy can modify the natural history \\nof multiple sclerosis, resulting in a substantial risk of pregnancy-related relapse and disability. Drug labels are typically \\nrestrictive and favour fetal safety over maternal safety. Emerging data reporting outcomes in neonates exposed to \\nDMTs in utero and through breastfeeding will allow for more careful and individualised treatment decisions. This \\nemerging research is particularly important to guide decision making in women with high disease activity or who are \\ntreated with DMTs associated with risk of discontinuation rebound. As increasing data are generated in this field, \\nperiodic updates will be required to provide the most up to date guidance on how best to achieve multiple sclerosis \\nstability during pregnancy and post partum, balanced with fetal and newborn safety.\\nIntroduction\\nMultiple sclerosis predominantly affects women; over the \\npast four decades, the female to male incidence ratio has \\nincreased to around 2:1–3:1.1 The disease is most \\ncommonly diagnosed between the ages of 20 years and \\n45 years, when considerations around family planning are \\nof importance to many people. Most women with multiple \\nsclerosis can have safe pregnancies and healthy children. \\nHowever, the increasing number of available disease-\\nmodifying therapies (DMTs)—some with teratogenic \\npotential—alongside a move towards early effective \\ntreatment, has introduced complexity into family \\nplanning.\\nA relative remission in multiple sclerosis disease activity \\nduring pregnancy is often relied on by neurologists and \\npatients.2 However, the immunological changes of \\npregnancy are not sufficient to protect women who with-\\ndraw from DMTs such as natalizumab or fin  golimod, \\nfrom severe disease reactivation.3,4 Importantly, the risk of \\npost-partum relapse has decreased over recent years, with \\nbetween 14% and 31% of women relapsing in the 3 months \\npost partum in modern (2010 and later) and historical \\n(before 2004) cohorts, respectively.2,5,6\\nThe management of active multiple sclerosis in women \\nplanning a pregnancy or discovering an unplanned \\npregnancy remains one of the most challenging aspects of \\nclinical management. Regulatory approvals around \\npregnancy and breastfeeding are often conservative and \\nrestrictive. Establishing the reproductive toxicity of drugs \\nvia inadvertent exposure can take decades. For instance, \\nEuropean regulatory advice for interferon beta was only \\nchanged in 2019, almost 25 years after its original approval \\nby the European Medicines Agency. Many physicians and \\nwomen opt to interrupt medication, often before starting \\nto try to conceive, due to a focus on possible drug-related \\nharms. This behaviour can lead to therapeutic inertia in \\nwomen with multiple sclerosis of childbearing age, \\nresulting in women not being treated or offered fewer or \\nless effective treatment options because they want to have \\nchildren.7 The situation is also problematic for breast -\\nfeeding, whereby default counselling is often to forego \\nbreastfeeding despite well-known health benefits for both \\nthe mother and child. Fortunately, label changes or \\napprovals in the last 5 years specifically consider breast-\\nfeeding safe in women treated with some DMTs.\\nProactive discussion with women and their families \\nis essential and requires careful consideration. The aim is \\nto obtain an optimal balance between the risks of \\nsuspending multiple sclerosis treatments and avoiding \\nthe adverse effects of DMTs on the fetus. This balance is \\nnot equal for all women, given the heterogeneity in disease \\nactivity and differing DMT profiles around pregnancy. \\nRisk estimates in modern cohorts (2010 and later) of \\npregnant women with multiple sclerosis with different \\nDMT exposures have been published in the past 5 years,3,5 \\nalong with an increasing amount of safety data on drug \\nexposure during both pregnancy and breastfeeding.\\nThis Review on family planning in multiple sclerosis \\nprovides an updated and comprehensive overview of \\naspects of relevance to women and men with multiple \\nsclerosis who are planning to have a family. We discuss \\nfertility and contraception, and counselling before, during, \\nand after pregnancy. Additionally, we evaluate findings on \\nthe short-term and long-term risk of relapse during and \\nafter pregnancy. Furthermore, we provide updated safety \\ninformation and recommendations on DMTs during \\npregnancy and breast  feeding. Importantly , gender is a \\nsocially constructed category, and people with multiple \\nsclerosis whose identity is different from woman or \\nmother can become pregnant and breastfeed. Our Review \\nreflects the available data on female patients who identify \\nas women and mothers, while recognising the need for \\nmore inclusive research and terminology.\\nFamily planning: non–DMT aspects\\nFertility\\nFertility does not seem to be directly affected by multiple \\nsclerosis.8 Lower pregnancy and birth rates in women '),\n",

In men, \\na large linkage study showed a potential association \\nbetween male infertility and an increased risk of multiple \\nsclerosis,12 but more conclusive studies are needed. Older \\nchemotherapy-based treatments that are now rarely used \\n(eg, mito  xantrone and cyclophosphamide) can affect \\nfertility in both women and men.\\nWomen with subfertility or infertility might undergo \\nassisted reproductive technology (ART). 8 Historical case \\nseries summarised in a meta-analysis suggested an \\nelevated relapse rate in women with multiple sclerosis \\nfollowing ART, particularly with gonadotrophin releasing \\nhormone agonist protocols or unsuccessful cycles.13 \\nLarger, more recent studies published in the past 5 years, \\nincluding a cohort of 12 women with 22 ART cycles13 and \\na population-based study of 225 women with 338 in vitro \\nfertilisation (IVF) cycles,14 did not show this elevated \\nrelapse rate, which was likely related to evolving DMT \\nuse and ART techniques, alongside changing diagnostic \\ncriteria. Women with multiple sclerosis should not be \\nadvised against ART and should be offered the approach \\nwith the highest chance of success, alongside aiming for \\noptimum disease control with a pregnancy-compatible \\nDMT.\\nSexual and bladder dysfunction, pain and depression, \\nand patient concerns about disability and disease course \\nalso affect family planning.9,15 Addressing these factors is \\ncrucial as part of holistic treatment.\\nContraception\\nStudies report conflicting results regarding use of oral \\ncontraception on the risk of multiple sclerosis; however,  \\nno association between oral contraceptive use and \\nsubsequent increased risk of multiple sclerosis has been \\nconsistently reported.16 Oral contraception use before or \\nafter clinically isolated syndrome does not significantly \\ninfluence the risk of conversion to multiple sclerosis or \\nof disability development.17\\nContraception should be regularly discussed with \\npeople with multiple sclerosis. The most effective \\nreversible contraceptive methods are long-acting, rever -\\nsible con  traceptives, including intrauterine devices and \\nimplants. Most methods can be used without restriction \\nin patients with multiple sclerosis; however, combined \\nhormonal contraceptives might increase the risk of \\nvenous throm boembolism, which is particularly relevant \\nin those who have mobility limitations or who are treated \\nwith corti costeroids. These highly effective methods are \\npreferable for people receiving potentially teratogenic \\nmedications.\\nAvailable studies show no significant pharmacokinetic \\ninteraction between oral contraception and oral \\nDMTs.18,19 Potential reduced absorption of oral \\ncontraception as a result of dimethyl fumarate-related \\ndiarrhoea or accel  erated elimination protocols for  \\nteriflunomide must be considered. Modafinil could \\ndecrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, \\nand some antiepileptic drugs used for pain or \\nparoxysmal symptoms might interact with hormonal \\ncontraceptives.\\nSupplements\\nTimely initiation of folic acid (≥3 months before trying \\nto conceive) and adequate vitamin D supplementation \\nbefore conception and during pregnancy (maximum \\n4000 IU per day) should be advised. Iron supple -\\nmentation might be required when women develop \\nanaemia before or during pregnancy; if oral iron is \\nused, care should be taken to avoid constipation.\\nVaccinations\\nPregnant individuals are at increased risk of infections \\nand are a priority group for vaccination. Live-attenuated \\nvaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy, whereas \\ninactivated vaccines are generally considered to be safe. \\nAdequate vaccine titres, including those important \\nduring pregnancy (eg, rubella), should be confirmed \\nbefore starting anti-CD20 therapies or S1P receptor \\nmodulators. Although anti-CD20 therapies and S1P \\nreceptor modulators might reduce vaccine response, \\nwomen should still be encouraged to access non-live \\nvaccinations. Data on vaccine response in offspring are \\nnot yet available. Influenza and pertussis vaccinations \\nduring pregnancy are specifically recommended in all \\nwomen by the National Health Service in the UK. \\nCOVID-19 vaccination can be safely given during \\npregnancy and breastfeeding.20,21\\nBirth choices and neonatal outcomes\\nHaving multiple sclerosis should not influence obstetric \\nmanagement outside of considerations related to \\ndisability and, possibly, fatigue. Women with multiple \\nsclerosis are often advised that their pregnancies should \\nbe treated as high risk but, outside of disability \\nconsiderations, this is not necessarily the case. Exposure \\nto potentially terato  genic medication or use of mono -\\nclonal antibodies during the second and third trimester \\nof pregnancy might require closer monitoring than \\nusual. Although women with multiple sclerosis have \\nhigher rates of labour induction, elective caesarean \\nsection, and small neonatal size for gestational age than \\npregnant women without multiple sclerosis, there is no \\nevidence for an increased risk of other adverse neonatal \\noutcomes.22,23 Fatigue has been reported as a limiting \\nfactor for vaginal birth. 24 Epidural anaesthesia or mode \\nof delivery are not associated with increased relapse rate \\nin the post-partum period.25'),\n",

Therefore, people with multiple sclerosis should \\nbe reassured that there is a low risk of multiple sclerosis \\nin their children. Avoidance of potentially modifiable \\nrisk factors of multiple sclerosis in offspring should be \\ndiscussed.\\nDisease course around pregnancy\\nShort-term risk and predictors of relapse\\nThe landmark Pregnancy in Multiple Sclerosis (PRIMS) \\nstudy showed that the annualised relapse rate decreased \\nfrom 0·7 in the 12 months before conception to 0·2 in the \\nthird trimester of pregnancy, then increased to 1·2 in the \\nfirst 3 months post partum, with about one-third of \\nwomen relapsing during this period.2 This protective \\neffect of the immunotolerant state of pregnancy, followed \\nby an increase in relapse activity post partum, has been \\nreplicated in many other studies.5,6 Possibly due to \\nimprovements in sensitivity and earlier diagnosis of \\nmultiple sclerosis, and changing use of DMTs, the relapse \\nrate seems to have progressively decreased over time.5,6,28\\nIn modern cohorts of women with multiple sclerosis, \\nthe relapse risk in untreated women, or in women treated \\nwith first-line therapies, is low during pregnancy and \\nremains relatively low post partum for term or preterm \\npregnancies (annualised relapse rate 0·47–0·51), with \\nonly 14% of women reported to relapse in the first \\n3 months following delivery in one cohort of 1998 preg -\\nnancies.5,28 However, even in the absence of clinical \\nrelapses, over 50% of women show new MRI activity in \\nthe first year post partum.29–32 In modern cohorts, relapse \\nactivity in the year before conception, younger patient age \\n(less than 35 years), and discon  tinuation of natalizumab \\nand fingolimod before pregnancy are predictors of \\nrelapses during preg nancy.5,33 Post-partum disease activity \\nhas been asso  ciated with pre-pregnancy disease activity \\n(eg, relapses and MRI) and severity (higher Expanded \\nDisability Status Scale [EDSS] scores), relapses during \\npregnancy, and preconception withdrawal of highly \\neffective therapies.5,29,33–35\\nThe withdrawal of sequestering and cell-trafficking \\nDMTs (eg, natalizumab, fingolimod, and possibly other \\nS1P receptor modulators) before or during pregnancy is \\nassociated with a particularly high risk of pregnancy-\\nrelated relapse.3–5,33,36 In a study of 274 pregnant women, \\nthe risk of severe relapse-related disability after natali -\\nzumab withdrawal was around 10% (29 of 274 women), \\nand 1% (3 of 274) of women had catastrophic relapses \\nresulting in an EDSS score of more than 8·5.4 This relapse \\nrisk confers a substantial risk of long-term disability, and \\nthere are reports of maternal mortality in the context of \\ndrug withdrawal for pregnancy.37 Continuing natalizumab \\ninto pregnancy can reduce this risk. The use of \\nnatalizumab during pregnancy is associated with a \\n24% reduction in the risk of relapse during pregnancy \\ncompared with discontinuation, and its use beyond the \\nfirst trimester normalised rate of relapses during \\npregnancy to similar rates reported with use of low-\\nefficacy DMTs before conception.5 The use of depleting \\nagents before pregnancy has also shown promising \\nresults of well controlled disease activity without rebound, \\neven when treatment was paused during pregnancy.34,38–41\\nAlthough still largely understudied, disease activity \\nafter spontaneously or electively terminated pregnancies \\nand stillbirths is approximately 10%.5 Preconception \\nrelapse activity,5,42 preconception gadolinium-enhancing \\nT1 lesions, and elective terminations42 are associated with \\nan increased relapse risk following pregnancy loss.\\nThe effects of breastfeeding and DMT use on post-\\npartum relapse risk and disability\\nObservational studies on the effect of breastfeeding on \\npost-partum relapse activity have shown variable findings; \\nhowever, a meta-analysis suggested a protective effect.43 \\nConfounders include heterogeneity in study design and \\nbreastfeeding practices, as well as reverse causality.\\nSurprisingly few data are available on the effect of early \\nDMT resumption on post-partum relapse risk. Logically, \\nprompt re-initiation of DMT should reduce relapses \\nthrough the course of the post-partum year. Unfortunately, \\na therapeutic lag exists for many medications,44 so \\nreducing the high relapse risk in the first 3 months post \\npartum can be challenging.\\nThere are currently insufficient data to understand \\nwhether continuing first-line injecta ble DMT during \\npregnancy reduces this relapse risk; data are likely to \\nemerge as an increasing number of women continue these \\nmedications during pregnancy. The continuation of \\nnatalizumab throughout pregnancy and the post-partum \\nperiod seems promising, but more data on the optimal \\ntiming of natalizumab administration during pregnancy \\nin terms of risk–benefit balance are needed. The use of \\ninduction treatments with long-lasting benefit, such as \\nalemtuzumab41 and cladribine,45 or long-acting anti-CD20 \\ntreatments, before pregnancy remains an option. \\nPregnancy-related relapses were rare in published cohort \\nstudies including approx  imately 220 pregnant women \\ntreated with anti-CD20 therapies, in whom the last infusion \\nwas generally given before pregnancy (approximately 80% \\n[n=180] within 6 months of conception) but with some \\ncases of accidental first trimester exposure (in less than \\n10%).29,34,38,40 However, even with potent immunomod  u-\\nlators (eg, alemtuzumab), the absolute risk of relapse post \\npartum is higher than the risk before pregnancy.41\\nThree DMT classes are officially approved for use \\nduring breastfeeding in Europe: interferon beta pre -\\nparations, glatiramer acetate, and ofatumumab.

Her multiple sclerosis was well \\ncontrolled on fingolimod for several years. At age 31 years, she \\ndecided to plan for pregnancy. She read that fingolimod should \\nbe stopped at least 2 months before attempting conception, so \\nshe stopped treatment and started prenatal vitamins. 2 months \\nlater, she stopped the oral contraceptive and began conception \\nattempts. \\n3 months after stopping fingolimod, she developed new \\nhorizontal binocular diplopia and gait ataxia that worsened \\nover 5 days. Brain MRI showed innumerable new and enhancing \\nlesions. These clinical and radiological findings indicated a \\nsevere rebound attack due to cessation of fingolimod. \\nFingolimod was resumed and she used barrier protection for \\ncontraception. She unexpectedly became pregnant while on \\nfingolimod. \\nFingolimod was stopped but, to avoid another rebound attack, \\nshe was started on natalizumab, despite positive JCV antibody \\nstatus, at extended interval dosing every 8 weeks, with the last \\ninfusion at 34 weeks of gestation. She delivered a healthy \\ninfant at 39 weeks of gestation, and the neonate had mild \\nanaemia and thrombocytopenia that self-resolved. She \\nresumed natalizumab 2 weeks post partum while \\nbreastfeeding. Due to JCV antibody seropositivity with rising \\nindex, she was transitioned to ocrelizumab at 3 months post \\npartum, which she continued while breastfeeding. She did not \\nhave a post-partum relapse, but unfortunately was left with \\ngait ataxia requiring a cane from her pre-pregnancy rebound \\nrelapse related to fingolimod cessation. Her infant had typical \\ngrowth, development, and no clinically significant infections \\nover the first 18 months of life.\\nKey points\\n•  Discuss regularly if family planning is a consideration and \\nadjust medications before pregnancy if necessary. \\n•  Before attempting conception, teriflunomide and S1P \\nreceptor modulators should be stopped. Teriflunomide \\nmust be actively eliminated by cholestyramine or charcoal, \\notherwise it will remain in the body for up to 2 years as a \\nresult of enterohepatic circulation. Patients of both sexes on \\ncladribine should be counselled not to attempt pregnancy \\nuntil at least 6 months after the last tablet. In case of \\naccidental exposure, organ screening ultrasonography and \\nreferral to a maternal–fetal medicine expert are \\nrecommended. \\n•  If stopping a disease-modifying therapy with risk of \\nrebound before conception, cell-depleting agents, such as \\nanti-CD20 therapies (eg, ocrelizumab, rituximab, or \\nofatumumab) or induction treatments (eg, cladribine or \\nalemtuzumab) can be used and timed before conception. \\nNatalizumab can also be used but should be continued \\nduring pregnancy due to its risks of rebound at \\ndiscontinuation. \\n•  Rituximab could be used off-label in patients with highly \\nactive disease, particularly in low-income and middle-\\nincome countries if approved disease-modifying therapies \\nare not available. \\n•  In the case of accidental pregnancy while on S1P receptor \\nmodulators and in women with a previous history of \\nrebound, consider switching to natalizumab during \\npregnancy to prevent rebound (with extended interval \\ndosing). \\n•  If natalizumab is used during pregnancy, the neonate should \\nbe checked for blood count abnormalities at birth and \\nlive-attenuated vaccinations should be postponed. \\n•  Women with multiple sclerosis should follow the same \\ndelivery and anaesthesia recommendations as women \\nwithout multiple sclerosis. \\n•  Women with multiple sclerosis can generally breastfeed if \\ndesired, while on some disease-modifying therapies: \\n•   Monoclonal antibody therapies, including anti-CD20 \\ntherapies and natalizumab, have emerging safety data \\nfor use while breastfeeding, and are suggested for \\nwomen at increased risk of post-partum relapses. \\n•   Breastfeeding while on interferon beta and glatiramer \\nacetate is also safe. \\ncontinued at extended interval dosing (6–8 weeks) until \\nthe third trimester (30–34 weeks of gestation) with early \\nreintroduction post partum, based on available data and \\nour experience.95\\nNewer drugs, such as ocrelizumab, have restrictive \\npregnancy labels in both the EU (contraception should \\nbe used for 12 months after the last infusion of ocreli -\\nzumab) and in the USA (contraception should be used \\nfor 6 months after the last infusion of ocrelizumab), \\ndespite reassuring safety data for use closer to pregnancy \\nin humans, including in the 3–6 months before \\nconception,29,34,38,40 leading to unnecessary concerns \\naround planning pregnancy. 7 The use of cell-depleting \\nmedications, such as cladribine 45 or alemtuzumab,41 and \\nparticularly anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies for \\npregnancy planning is gaining traction, both to serve as \\na bridge therapy for women who are discontinuing \\nnatalizumab and S1P receptor modulators, and more \\ngenerally to stabilise disease in patients with active \\nmultiple sclerosis. Overall, a low rate of relapses has \\nbeen described in women who received anti-CD20 \\ntherapies within 3 months, or even 6 months, before \\nconception,29,38,40,115 including in women transitioning \\nfrom fingolimod or natalizumab before pregnancy. \\nBased on available data and our experience, we suggest \\ntargeting the last dose of anti-CD20 therapies shortly \\nbefore pregnancy, but ideally not during pregnancy \\nitself.'),\n",

Small molecules (mostly oral medications) \\ncan cross the placental barrier easily at any timepoint, \\nwhereas the placenta is a mechanical barrier for larger \\nmolecules (eg, injectables or monoclonal antibodies). \\nOral drugs with potential teratogenicity must be stopped \\nbefore pregnancy. Specific active transport mechanisms \\nvia fragment crystallizable receptors allow monoclonal \\nantibodies to cross the placental barrier from the second \\ntrimester of pregnancy. Therefore, teratogenicity related \\nto early exposure is highly unlikely but biological effects, \\nsuch as haematological or immunological changes, in \\nneonates exposed to these agents through maternal \\ntreatment in mid-pregnancy or late pregnancy can be \\nseen.39,40,95 Therefore, we recommend checking total \\nlymphocyte and B-cell counts at birth in infants with \\nanti-CD20 therapy exposure during the second or the \\nthird trimester of pregnancy. In case of neonatal \\nlymphopenia or low B-cell count, live vaccinations, such \\nas BCG and rotavirus, should be postponed until \\nnormalisation of B cells. Natalizumab exposure in utero \\nduring the third trimester can cause reversible anaemia \\nand thrombocytopenia in the neonate, which should be \\nevaluated and managed with the assistance of \\npaediatricians, and postponing live vaccines in neonates \\nwith third trimester exposure should be considered.95\\nAutologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is \\nincreasingly used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis \\nat an earlier stage in the disease course than when \\ninitially trialled. BEAM (comprising carmustine, \\netoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) and cyclo -\\nphosphamide-containing conditioning regimens are \\nanticipated to reduce fertility. Patients should be \\ncounselled about this risk of reduced fertility, with \\nconsideration for referral to a fertility specialist for egg \\nharvesting or sperm collection and cryopreservation \\nbefore treatment initiation. Spontaneous conceptions, \\nwithout the need for fertility treatment, have been \\nreported following autologous haemopoietic stem-cell \\ntrans plan tation in women and in the female partners of \\ntreated men,116 and further prospective data collection is \\nrequired to accurately assess the effects of this procedure \\non fertility.\\nThe competing fetal or neonatal risks of DMT exposure \\nversus the maternal risks of treatment discontinuation \\nmust be balanced, incorporating evolving scientific \\nknowledge (figure 1). Modern medical peripartum \\nmanage ment must incorporate the best risk–benefit \\nanalysis for both mother and child, related to pregnancy \\nplanning and breast  feeding, including peripartum \\nmaternal treatment contin  uation, if necessary. During \\nthe past decade, national and international pregnancy \\nregistries, along with pharmacovigilance studies, have \\nprovided valuable data that have helped to facilitate \\nthis decision making, avoiding harmful therapeutic \\ninertia and unnecessary treatment withdrawal. \\nRecom  mendations based on our collective experience \\nand expert interpretation of the most up-to-date available \\ndata are given in table 1 and figure 2. \\nTreatment of relapses during pregnancy\\nRelapse treatment during pregnancy needs to balance \\naccelerated functional recovery with potential treatment-\\nassociated risk. Relapses with minor symptoms or not \\ninterfering with daily activities should not be treated. For \\nrelapses requiring treatment, non-fluorinated corti  co-\\nsteroids, including prednisone, prednisolone, and \\nmethyl prednisolone, are preferred due to minimal \\npla cen tal transfer and short half-life. 117 Usually, \\n500–1000 mg methylprednisolone (or equivalent) daily \\nfor 3–5 days are recommended.\\nAnimal studies have previously suggested a theoretical \\nincrease in the risk of cleft palate with corticosteroid \\nexposure during the first trimester, but findings \\nin humans are less consistent, and more recent data, \\nwithin the past 10 years, do not show an association.

Input from a multidisciplinary \\nteam, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and \\nsocial worker support, can assist with ambulatory function, \\nspasticity, energy conservation, and adequate social and \\nfinancial support during the post-partum period.\\nMRI during pregnancy and post partum\\nMRI is not routinely indicated during pregnancy, and its \\nlong-term predictive value post partum is unclear. If \\nneeded for new or worsening symptoms of multiple \\nsclerosis, MRI can be performed during each trimester of \\npregnancy without increasing the risk of adverse preg -\\nnancy outcomes, including congenital anomalies. 141 \\nGadolinium-based contrast agents have been associated \\nwith a rare risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, or inflam -\\nmatory skin disorders in one study, and should be used \\nduring pregnancy only if critically needed.141,142 In the post-\\npartum period, breastfeeding is compatible with \\ngadolinium-based contrast agents and can be continued \\nwithout interruption due to the low amount excreted in \\nbreastmilk.142\\nSymptomatic treatments during pregnancy and \\npost partum\\nThere is an absence of data on the safety of symptomatic \\ntherapies in pregnancy and during breastfeeding. There \\nshould be careful individualised decision making as \\nto whether medication is required, and use of poly -\\npharmacotherapy should be minimised. If needed, \\nwomen should be promptly referred for physiotherapy \\nand psychological therapies to complement medication.\\nPregnancy itself poses a risk of perinatal depression, \\nand there seems to be an increased risk of peripartum \\ndepression in parents with multiple sclerosis.139,143 If the \\nbenefit of continuing antidepressants outweighs \\npotential risks, continuing medication during pregnancy \\nand breastfeeding is justified. If possible, selective \\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with the largest \\nbody of evidence on safety in pregnancy, such as \\nsertraline or citalopram, should be considered. Women \\nwho are stable on antidepressants should have careful \\nconsideration of risks and benefits before switching. In \\nneonates exposed to an SSRI during pregnancy, poor \\nneonatal adaption, including hyperexcitability in the first \\n2 weeks of life, might be seen in up to 20–30% of \\ninfants.144\\nWhen antiepileptic drugs are needed, the lowest dose \\nand least teratogenic medication should be used. Existing \\ndata on baclofen are scarce; however, an increased risk of \\ncongenital malformations was seen in one study, and \\nthere is a risk of neonatal withdrawal.145 Tizanidine shows \\ntoxicity in animal studies. 146 Benzodiazepines are not \\nassociated with congenital malformations, but neonatal \\nwithdrawal is a risk when they are used throughout \\npregnancy. Modafinil is associated with an increased risk \\nof congenital malformations and should be avoided in \\npregnancy.147\\nFamily planning in low-income or middle-\\nincome countries\\nFew studies have investigated multiple sclerosis and \\npregnancy in low-income and middle-income settings. \\nAccess to health-care services can be poor and differs by \\ncountry, with some countries having substantial out-of-\\npocket costs for health care. DMT availability and afford-\\nability differ in resource-limited settings, with some \\ncountries able to access only platform self-injectable \\nDMTs.148 Rituximab could be an affordable option in \\nsome resource-limited settings. Cultural differences, \\nincluding traditional roles of women, also vary between \\ncountries, which might affect choices about prioritising \\nthe health of the child over that of the mother, even \\nthough maternal health is important to support fetal \\nhealth.

Importantly, multiple sclerosis does not seem to \\nadversely influence fertility or birth outcomes. Inflam -\\nmatory disease activity tends to decrease during preg nancy \\nbut increase post partum, with lower disease activity \\nobserved in modern cohorts of pregnant women either \\nnot receiving treatment or receiving platform first-line \\ntherapies than previously reported. Modern cohorts show \\nhigh risks of in-pregnancy relapse and disability in women \\nstopping S1P receptor modulators or natalizumab before \\nconception, whereas anti-CD20 therapies continued until \\nshortly before pregnancy, induction treatments before \\npregnancy, and the continuation of natalizumab during \\npregnancy, seem to result in well-controlled disease. Data \\non the safety of some DMTs during breastfeeding are \\nemerging.\\nGiven heterogeneity in multiple sclerosis, personalised \\ncare is important. Clinicians and patients must balance \\npotential risks to the fetus or neonate from drug exposure \\nduring pregnancy and breastfeeding with maternal risks \\nof treatment discontinuation or the decision not to \\nre-initiate therapy post partum. For women with active \\ndisease, DMT use is important to avoid accumulation of \\ndemyelinating lesions and irreversible  disability due to \\nrelapses during pregnancy and in the post-partum period. \\nMultiple sclerosis should not be undertreated due to \\npregnancy desire and, with appropriate planning, most \\nwomen with multiple sclerosis are able to safely have \\nchildren. Understanding predictors of relapse activity \\nduring pregnancy and in the post-partum period is an \\nunmet need. More data are also needed to confirm \\nwhether factors associated with peripartum relapse can be \\nreduced by judicious use of DMTs before conception and \\nafter delivery. The evaluation of re-initiation of effective \\nDMTs with short therapeutic lag early post partum also \\nrequires further study. As new DMTs emerge, ongoing \\ncollection of safety data on pregnancy exposure and \\nlactation are required. Despite these challenges, treating \\nmultiple sclerosis through the pregnancy and post-partum \\nperiod is potentially one of the most rewarding aspects of \\ntreating people with multiple sclerosis. The emergence of \\ntelemedicine could improve access to care by specialists \\nwith expertise in pregnancy and multiple sclerosis.\\nContributors\\nKH designed the Review.

It is \\na chronic, debilitating, demyelinating disease caused by \\nan autoimmune attack that results in the progressive \\nloss of the myelin sheath surrounding neuronal  axons. \\nThe condition can be thought of as a stripped electrical \\nwire and, as with damaged electrical wires, signals sent \\nalong damaged nerves between the brain and the body \\ncan be slowed or blocked. Depending on which nerves \\nare involved, the resultant de crease in the speed of \\nsignal transduction leads to a loss of functionality that \\nincludes both cognitive and motor impairment, \\nsensations, and other functions. The inflammatory \\nresponse contributes to the loss of the grey matter and, \\nas a result, current literature devotes itself to combatting \\nthe auto -inflammatory aspect of the disease. There are \\nseveral proposed causal links between the Epstein -Barr \\nvirus (EBV) and the HLA -DRB1*15:01 allele to the \\nonset of MS. While contributing to the degree of \\nautoimmune attack and the resultant inflammation, \\nunfortunately, such links do not determine the onset of \\nMS. In this article, I analyze demyelinating \\nautoimmune diseases, defining as accurately as could be \\nthe disease, its types and variants, its signs, symptoms, \\nand stages, and its pathophysiology and causes. \\n \\n \\n \\nα-Syn: Alpha-synuclein protein; AD: Alzheimer's \\ndisease; ANS: Autonomic nervous system; ASON: Anti-\\nsense oligonucleotide; A TMP: Advanced therapy \\nmedicinal products; BDNF: Brain-derived neurotrophic \\nfactor; BP: Blood pressure; CBD: Corticobasal \\ndegeneration; CNS: Central nervous system; CT: \\nComputerized tomography; CUP: Compassionate use \\nprogram; DMD/T: Disease-modifying drugs/therapies; \\nFTLD: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration; GCI: Glial \\ncytoplasmic inclusions; GDNF: Glial-derived \\nneurotropic factor; GHT: GHT: Growth hormone \\ntherapy; GT: Gene therapy; GWAS: Genome-wide \\nassociation study; IGF: Insulin/insulin-like growth \\nfactor; IT: Immunotherapy; LB: Lewy bodies; LBD: \\nCASE STUDY                                                                                                                                                                 Open Access \\n \"),\n",

A majority of patients \\nexperience early relapsing and remitting episodes of \\nneuronal deterioration following a period of recovery. \\nSome of these individuals may transition to a more \\nlinear progression of the disease,  while about 15% of \\nothers begin with a progressive course on the onset of \\nMS. It is estimated that 50 million people worldwide \\nhave neurodegenerative diseases and that, by 2050, this \\nfigure will increase to 115 million people. \\n \\nThe progression of MS occur s due to episodes of \\nincreasing inflammation, which is proposed to be due to \\nthe release of certain antigens (myelin oligodendrocyte \\nglycoprotein; myelin basic protein; proteolipid protein, \\nand others), causing an autoimmune response. This sets \\noff a casca de of signaling molecules that result in T -\\ncells, B -cells, and macrophages that cross the blood -\\nbrain barrier (BBB) and attack the myelin on neuronal \\naxons, leading to inflammation. Further release of \\nantigens drives subsequent degeneration, causing \\nincreased inflammation. \\n \\nNow, a demyelinating disease can be caused by genetics, \\nenvironmental factors, autoimmune reactions, and other \\nunknown factors. Environmental factors can be \\ntriggered by a viral infection, chemical exposure factors \\n(including organophosp hate poisoning by commercial \\ninsecticides such as sheep dip, weed killers, and flea \\ntreatment preparations for pets). Chronic neuroleptic \\nexposure may also cause demyelination as \\n(controversially) may Vitamin B12 deficiency. \\n \\nIn this article, I analyze dem yelinating autoimmune \\ndiseases (the parent of MS), define MS, its phenotypes, \\nvariants and stages, and its etiology and causes. In  \\ncompanion articles, I will  consider the different \\napproaches to managing the symptoms of the disease, \\nthe available trea tment portfolio and the prognosis of \\nthe disease. \\n \\n \\n \\nA demyelinating disease is any condition that \\ncauses damage to the protective covering (myelin \\nsheath) that surrounds nerve fibers in the brain, the \\noptic nerves that lead to the eyes, and the spinal cord.  \\nThis attack causes inflammation and injury to the nerve \\nsheath and ultimately to the nerve fibers that it \\nsurrounds. When the myelin sheath is damaged, nerve \\nimpulses slow or even stop, causing neurological \\nproblems. The damage impairs the conduction of \\nsignals in the affected nerves. The process can result in \\nmultiple areas of scarring (sclerosis). In turn, the \\nreduction in conduction ability causes deficiencies in \\nsensation, movement, cognition, or other functio ns, \\ndepending on which nerves are involved.

Plaques can be as small as a \\npinhead or as large as a golf ball. In the brain, MS \\ndamages the nerve cell bodies found in the gray matter \\nas well as the axons themselves commonly called white \\nmatter. Elsewhere in the central nervous system (CNS), \\nit attacks the spinal cord and the optic nerves that \\ntransmit visual information from the eyes to the brain.  \\nAs the disease progresses, the outermost layer of the \\nbrain, called the cerebral cortex, shrinks (this is what is \\nknown as 'cortical atrophy'). \\n \\nDuring an MS exacerbation, most of the myelin (and to \\na lesser extent the axons within the affected area) is \\ndamaged or destroyed by different types of immune \\ncells (also known as 'inflammation'). The symptoms of \\nMS depend on the severity of the inflammatory \\nreaction as well as the location and extent of the \\nplaques, which primarily appear in the brain stem, \\ncerebellum (involved with balance and coordination of \\nmovement, among other functions), spinal cord, optic \\nnerves, and the white matter around the brain ventricles \\n(fluid-filled spaces). \\n \\nNow, demyelinating diseases are traditionally classified \\nin two kinds: De myelinating myelinoclastic diseases \\nand demyelinating leukodystrophic diseases. In the \\nfirst group, a normal and healthy myelin is destroyed \\nby a toxicant, a chemical, or an autoimmune substance. \\nIn the second group, myelin is abnormal and \\ndegenerates. \\n \\nIn MS, evidence has shown that the body's own \\nimmune system is at least partially responsible. \\nAcquired immune system cells called T -cells are \\nknown to be present at the site of lesions. Other \\nimmune-system cells called macrophages (and possibly \\nmast cells) also contribute to the damage. \\n \\nDemyelinating diseases can be caused by genetics, \\nautoimmune reactions, environmental factors (such as \\nbeing triggered by a viral infection, a chemical \\nexposure, chronic neuroleptic exposure, and vitamin \\nB12 deficiency), and other unknown factors. Regarding \\nchemical exposure, organophosphate poisoning by \\ncommercial insecticides such as sheep dip, weed killers, \\nand flea treatment preparations for pets can also result \\nin nerve demyelination. Other types of demyelinating \\ndiseases and their causes include: Optic neuritis (ON), \\nneuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), \\nmyelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody -\\nassociated disease (MOGAD), transverse myelitis \\n(TM), and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis \\n(ADEM). I will not dwell here on these various \\ndiseases (for more details, see Fymat 2023.) \\n \\n \\n \\nMS is a primary example of an autoimmune illness of \\nthe central nervous system (CNS). It is the most \\ncommon immune-mediated disorder affecting the CNS. \\nThis autoimmune attack results in the progressive loss \\nof the myelin sheath covering neuronal axons. The \\nresultant decrease in (or loss of) the speed of signal \\ntransduction leads to a loss of functionality that \\nincludes both cognitive and motor impairments \\ndepending on the location of the lesion. \\n \\nAlso known as encephalomyelitis disseminata, MS is a \\nmyelinating disease in which the immune system, \\nwhich normally protects the body, attacks the \\nprotective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers. The \\nname multiple sclerosis refers to the numerous glial \\nscars (or sclerae – essentially plaques or lesions) that \\ndevelop on the white matter of the brain and spinal \\ncord. It is an unpredictable, often disabling disease of \\nthe CNS. It is not contagious. \\n \"),\n",

Damage to the myelin \\ncauses communication problems between the brain and \\nthe rest of the body, affecting the brain and the spinal \\ncord that make up the CNS. The condition can be \\nthought of as a stripped electrical wire and, as with \\ndamaged electrical wires, signals sent along damaged \\nnerves between the brain and the body can be slowed \\nor blocked. \\n \\nMS is the most common potentially dis abling and \\ndebilitating neurologic illness of North American and \\nEuropean young and middle -aged adults. The average \\nperson in the U.S. has about a 1 in 750 (0.13%) chance \\nof developing it. At least 2.3 million people worldwide \\nhave MS of whom roughly 1.3 m illion have relapsing \\nMS. An estimated 1 million people live with MS in the \\nU.S. In the U.K., there are about 130,000 people living \\nwith MS. When they were first told they had MS, 85% \\nof them were diagnosed with the relapsing -remitting \\n(RRMS) type (to be l ater discussed). In that country, \\nthey are most likely to find out they have MS in their \\n30s, 40s, and 50s but the first signs of MS often start \\nyears earlier. \\n \\nPeople from many different ethnic backgrounds can get \\nMS. Many of them notice their first sympt oms years \\nbefore they get their diagnosis. Symptom onset \\ngenerally occurs between the ages of 20 to 50 years, \\naffecting women three times more often than men. A \\nsmall number of those with MS will have a mild course \\nwith little to no disability, whereas oth ers will have a \\nsteadily worsening disease that leads to increased \\ndisability over time. Most people with MS, however, \\nwill have short periods of symptoms followed by long \\nstretches of relative quiescence (inactivity or \\ndormancy), with partial or full reco very. For unknown \\nreasons, women are affected more frequently (about \\nthree times) compared to men. In the long -term, \\npregnancy does not affect how someone’s MS develops. \\nMost medications are not recommended during \\npregnancy so if you are planning to become  pregnant, \\nor think you might already be, you should discuss this \\nwith your MS nurse or doctor. \\n \\nThe disease is rarely fatal and most people with MS \\nhave a normal life expectancy. It is a chronic disease \\nthat affects people differently. It is further \\nunpredictable and everyone’s MS is different. It may \\nhave a prodromal phase in the years leading up to MS \\nmanifestation, and is characterized by psychiatric \\nissues, cognitive impairment, and increased utilization \\nof healthcare. Once diagnosed, it stays with the  \\nindividual for life but treatments and specialists can \\nhelp manage the condition and its symptoms. \\nEventually, the disease can cause permanent damage or \\ndeterioration of the nerves. Currently, there are still no \\ncures and no clear ways to prevent the dise ase from \\ndeveloping. Fortunately, new treatments can reduce \\nlong-term disability for many people with MS. \\n \\nSymptoms range from numbness and tingling to \\nblindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure \\nfor MS. The progress, severity and specific symp toms \\nof MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but \\nadvances in research and treatment are leading to better \\nunderstanding and moving us closer to a world free of \\nMS. \\n \\n \\n \\nLosses of function during MS may b e temporary or \\nlong lasting, and everyone’s experience with MS is \\ndifferent. The disease takes several forms, with new \\nsymptoms either occurring in isolated attacks \\n(relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive \\nforms). The course of MS can be cla ssified into the \\nfour basic patterns below: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS): In RRMS, \\nmost people will have a relapsing -remitting disease \\ncourse. They experience periods of new symptoms or \\nrelapses that develop over days or weeks and usually '),\n",

These relapses are \\nfollowed by quiet periods of disease remission that can \\nlast months or even years. Small increases in body \\ntemperature can temporarily worsen signs and \\nsymptoms of MS but these are not considered true \\ndisease relapses. Symptoms may disappear completely, \\nalthough some permanent neurological problems often \\nremain, especially as the disease advances. Most \\npeople will have a relapsing -remitting course, which \\noften develops in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). \\nThe term 'benign' is sometimes used to refer to RRMS \\ncases in which the disease is mild and the patient \\nremains fully functional in all systems for 10 -15 years. \\nBecause of this long time period, it is difficult to \\nreliably predict and formulate early treatment deci sions. \\n(Note: This disease type does not figure in the accepted \\nMacDonald's classification discussed below). \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Secondary progressive MS (SPMS): In \\nSPMS, at least 50% of those affected eventually \\ndevelop a steady progression of symptoms, with or \\nwithout periods of remission, within 10 to 20 years \\nfrom disease onset. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Primary progressive MS (PPMS): In PPMS, \\nthe worsening of symptoms usually includes problems \\nwith mobility and gait. The rate of disease progression \\nvaries greatly and some people will experie nce a \\ngradual onset and steady progression of signs and \\nsymptoms without experiencing any relapses. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Peculiar developments:  Such developments \\nmay be particular characteristics of MS. They include: \\nUhthoff's phenomenon (UP) - a worsening of \\nsymptoms due to exposure to higher than usual \\ntemperatures and Lhermitte's sign (LS) - an electrical \\nsensation that runs down the back when bending the \\nneck. \\n \\n \\n \\nIt is impossible to answer the questio n of how fast MS \\nwill get worse as everyone’s MS is different. Research \\nis hoping to find ways to better predict this for each \\nindividual. Until then, we do know that MS tends to get \\nworse faster if one: Has never been on a disease -\\nmodifying drug/therapy ( DMD/T); still had relapses \\nwhile on DMD/Ts; has lesions on the spinal cord; has \\nmore or bigger lesions (or other unusual signs) on brain \\nscans; has more disability early on; is older; is male; \\nhas a faster rate of brain atrophy. On average, there is \\nno dif ference between people with SPMS and PPMS \\nwhen it comes to how fast their MS gets worse. \\n \\nMS can cause many complications, some of which are \\na direct result of the disease and others are a \\nconsequence of MS treatments. The main complication \\nthat occurs as MS progresses is vision problems such \\nas blurry vision, diplopia, nystagmus and, in more \\nsevere cases, vision loss. Other common complications \\ninclude bladder and bowel problems, such as \\nconstipation, diarrhea, and urinary and fecal \\nincontinence.  \\n \\nMS can also cause cognitive impairment and mental \\nhealth complications. Cognitive issues may include \\nmemory loss, slower intellectual processing, reduced \\nability to problem-solve, and impairment of verbal and \\nvisual-spatial abilities. Anxiety, depression, and bipolar \\ndisorder are also more common in patients with MS \\nthan in the general population. These complications \\ncould be the result of neuronal damage caused by the \\ndisease, the burden of having to live with a chronic \\ncondition, or a side effect of certain medi cations such \\nas corticosteroids used to treat MS relapses.  \\n \\nOther complications related to the use of \\ncorticosteroids include weight gain, mood disorders, \\ninfections, hypertension, ocular hypertension, \\nhyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, fractures, cataracts, \\nbruises, adrenal insufficiency, and venous \\nthromboembolism (which can also be the result of MS \\ncomplications such as disability, spasticity, and reduced \\nmobility, although the risk is low). \"),\n",

Phenotypes \\nuse the past course of the disease in an attempt to \\npredict the future course. They are important not o nly \\nfor prognosis but also for treatment decisions.  \\n \\nThe International Advisory Committee on Clinical \\nTrials (IACCT) of MS describes five types of MS \\n(revised in 2013). Independently of the types published \\nby the MS associations, regulatory agencies like the \\n(U.S.) Food & Drug Administration (FDA) often \\nconsider special courses, trying to reflect results of me \\nclinical trials on their approval documents. Some \\nexamples could be \"Highly Active MS\" (HAMS), \\n\"Active Secondary MS\" (ASMS), which is similar to \\nthe old “Progressive -Relapsing MS” (PRMS), and \\n\"Rapidly progressing” (RPMS).  \\n \\nAlso, when deficits always resolve between attacks, \\nthis is sometimes referred to as “Benign MS” (BMS), \\nalthough people will still build up some degree of \\ndisability in the long te rm. On the other hand, the term \\n“Malignant MS” (MMS) is used to describe people \\nwith MS who have reached a significant level of \\ndisability in a short period of time. In addition, an \\ninternational panel has published a standardized \\ndefinition for the course  of MS. These several \\nphenotypes will now be revisited. \\n \\nActive multiple sclerosis (AMS) \\n \\nIn AMS, the immune system attacks myelin, the fatty \\nprotective covering around nerves. When this happens, \\ninflammation showing as new lesions (areas of damage \\nto nerves) are seen on MRI scans of the brain or spinal \\ncord.  \\n \\nAnother sign that the immune system is attacking \\nmyelin is when having a relapse. The symptoms \\nsuddenly get worse or new ones appear. A relapse is \\nusually followed by some sort of recovery as the bod y \\ndoes its best to repair the myelin.  \\n \\nIf the MS does not cause relapses or inflammation, it is \\n‘not active’. Note that people with all types of MS \\nmight describe it as ‘active’ during a flare -up of their \\nsymptoms, or if their MS is generally getting wors e. \\nThis is not to be confused with the clinical definition \\nwherein “active” means the presence of inflammation \\nor relapses. If the symptoms and disability keep getting \\nworse, the disease will instead be called \\'progressive” \\n(see below).  \\n \\nRelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) \\n \\nRRMS is the most common type of MS - around 85% \\nof people with MS are diagnosed with this type. It \\nusually begins with a clinically-isolated syndrome (CIS) \\nin which a person has an attack suggestive of \\ndemyelination but does n ot fulfill the criteria for MS. \\nAbout 30% to 70% of persons who experience a CIS \\nlater develop MS.  \\n \\nRRMS in first-diagnosed patients is characterized by an \\nunpredictable pattern of relapses (symptoms getting \\nworse) followed by periods of months to years of \\nrelative quiet (remissions) with no new signs of disease \\nactivity. People often recover well from a relapse with \\ncomplete remission. But around half of all relapses may \\nleave some lingering problems. Relapses often last a \\nnumber of weeks and possibly ev en months. Taking a \\ndisease modifying drug/therapy (DMD/T) can mean \\nfewer and less serious relapses and it could slow down \\nthe disease. The disability does not necessarily get \\nworse between relapses but, after each relapse, it can \\nend up worse than before.  As time goes on, the body \\nfinds it harder to repair the damage each relapse brings. \\nThe disability is likely to get worse, especially if one \\ndoes not start treatment. \\n \\nDeficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or '),\n",

Most people with MS are initially \\ndiagnosed with this form of the disease.  \\n  \\nTo be classed as a relapse, the symptoms need to last for \\n24 hours or more, and not be caused by an infection. \\nThey would also need to happen at least 30 days after \\nany previous relapse.  For days, weeks or months, the \\nsymptoms may get worse or new ones may appear. \\nThen, while the bod y does its best to repair the \\ndamaged myelin, the symptoms can get better or go \\ncompletely. This recovery is called remission during \\nwhich MS can still be damaging the nerves and one \\nmight nonetheless be left with some disability. As time \\ngoes on, it gets harder for the body to repair the damage \\nafter each relapse.  \\n \\nPrimary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS)  \\n \\nPPMS is less common and is characterized by \\nprogressively worsening symptoms from the beginning \\nwith no noticeable relapses or exacerbations of t he \\ndisease, although there may be temporary or minor \\nrelief from symptoms. Some unknown cause is \\ndamaging the nerves. The build -up of disability or \\nsymptoms is usually quite slow with some exceptions. \\nIn the past, this situation was called “progressive \\nrelapsing MS” (PRMS); now it is called “active primary \\nprogressive MS” (APPMS). \\n \\nPPMS occurs in approximately 10% –20% of \\nindividuals with the disease, with no remission after the \\ninitial symptoms. They tend to be diagnosed with it in \\ntheir 40s or older. Men a re just as likely as women to \\nget it, unlike relapsing MS which affects women more.  \\n \\nPPMS is characterized by progression of disability from \\nonset, with no, or only occasional and minor, remissions \\nand improvements. The disease gets steadily worse with \\noccasional relapses. MRI scans show inflammation is \\nstill happening. The usual age of onset for the PPMS \\nsubtype is later than that of the RRMS subtype. It \\nusually begins around 40 years of age. A few DMD/Ts \\ncan help with the inflammation and relapses that c ome \\nwith PPMS if it has an active part to it.  \\n \\nThere are two main kinds of PPMS diagnosis; the line \\nbetween them and relapsing MS is not very clear, even \\nto specialists.  \\n \\nEvolving to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis \\n(SPMS) \\n \\nMost people with RRMS will eventually develop SPMS. \\nIt varies widely from person to person, but on average, \\naround 65% of people with RRMS will develop SPMS \\n15 years after being diagnosed. Usually, with SPMS, \\ndisability or other symptoms gradually get worse. The \\nold pattern of getting relapses followed by getting better \\nusually comes to an end. However, some people may \\nstill get relapses but with no full recovery afterwards. \\nHaving relapses means there still is active SPMS - \\n'active' meaning the immune system is still attacking the \\nmyelin around the nerves, causing inflammation. A \\nrelapse is a sign of this inflammation. Another sign of it \\nis when new lesions can be seen in the MRI scans. \\n \\nSPMS patients might notice more difficulties getting \\naround than before, or other symptoms might get worse, \\nchanges happening very slowly. Everyone's MS is \\ndifferent - even if someone else has SPMS, they are \\nlikely to be affected in an individual way. \\n \\nSecondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS)  \\n \\nSPMS is a stage of MS which comes after RRMS  for \\nmany people.

In \\nthe past, before DMD/Ts came along, it usually took \\nmany years for relapsing MS to change into SPMS. The \\nmost common length of time between d isease onset and \\nconversion from RRMS to SPMS is 19 years. But, \\nthanks to today’s MS drugs, this is changing: fewer \\npeople are likely to go on to SPMS and, for those that \\ndo, it could take longer to happen. In a small number of \\ncases, some people are not d iagnosed with MS until \\ntheir condition has reached the secondary progressive \\nstage.  \\n \\nSPMS occurs in around 65% of those with initial \\nRRMS who eventually have progressive neurologic \\ndecline between acute attacks without any definite \\nperiods of remission. O ccasional relapses and minor \\nremissions may appear.  \\n \\nPeople with SPMS usually have had a previous history \\nof MS attacks, but then start to develop gradual and \\nsteady symptoms and deterioration in their function \\nover time. Most individuals with severe RRMS may go \\non to develop SPMS if they are left untreated.  \\n \\nSPMS is thus called because the progressive stage \\ncomes second, after an earlier stage that had \\ninflammation and relapses. A lot of people who start off \\nwith relapsing MS see it turn into SPMS many years \\nlater.  \\n \\nThe body can repair myelin on its own, b ut after each \\nattack on it, it finds it harder to repair. As demyelination \\noccurs, the nerve underneath becomes exposed. Over \\ntime, it suffers damage, stops working, and does not \\ngrow back. When nerves break down like this, it leads \\nto a build -up of sympto ms and disability. Eventually, \\nthe pattern of relapses followed by recovery comes to \\nan end. Inflammation and relapses usually stop, or they \\nhappen much less often. What is left thereafter is \\ndamaging the nerves in a way we do not yet fully \\nunderstand.  \\n \\nDisability or symptoms used to be stable between \\nrelapses, but now things gradually get worse making it \\ndifficult to discern when relapsing MS has changed into \\nSPMS. The change to SPMS is likely if the disability or \\nsymptoms get slowly worse over at least s ix months \\nwithout a relapse happening. Some people with SPMS \\ncan still sometimes have a relapse or get inflammation \\non their MRI scans.  \\n \\nIn the past, it usually took up to 20 years on average for \\nrelapsing MS to change into SPMS. Now that people \\nwith rela psing MS take DMD/Ts, this is changing for \\nthe better in that fewer people go on to SPMS and, for \\nthose that do, it should take longer to happen.  \\n \\nProgressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) \\n \\nFor some people with PMS from the very start, their \\nsymptoms and disab ility gradually keep getting worse \\nover the years (‘progression’ here means ‘things are \\ngetting worse’). There are no periods of remission and \\nthe condition gradually gets worse over time. But, the \\nspeed at which this happens varies greatly and it is not \\nyet possible to predict exactly how it will affect one \\nperson. Obvious signs of inflammation can be seen on \\ntheir MRI scans. The pattern of relapses followed by \\nrecovery, like with relapsing MS, is not seen. \\nInflammation has stopped, or there was not much t o \\nbegin with. Instead, something else is now damaging \\nthe nerves directly. We do not yet know what is causing \\nthe nerves to break down and stop working. For another, \\nand much bigger, group of people with active (relapsing) \\nMS, after many years, their body cannot repair or \\nreplace damaged myelin any longer. Relapses and \\ninflammation stop, their MS has now become \\nprogressive. Compared to active MS, progressive MS \\ndoes not have as many disease -modifying \\ndrugs/therapies (DMD/Ts) to treat it.

Symptoms experienced before, or perhaps \\naccustomed to dealing with, might appear in a different \\npart of the body.They usually come on over a short \\nperiod of time – over hours or days. They often stay for \\na number o f weeks and, for most people, are usually \\nover within a month. But, this can vary from very short \\nperiods of only a few days to many months. For \\nexample, some people experience a shock -like \\nsensation when they bend their neck. This can be \\nconsidered a relapse if, for 24 hours or more, it happens \\nevery time one bends one's neck.  \\n \\nSymptoms vary from person to person and from one \\nexacerbation to another. For example, the exacerbation \\nmight be an episode of optic neuritis (caused by \\ninflammation of the optic n erve that impairs vision), or \\nproblems with balance or severe fatigue. Some relapses \\nproduce only one symptom (related to inflammation in \\na single area of the CNS). Other relapses cause two or \\nmore symptoms at the same time (related to \\ninflammation in more than one area of the CNS). \\n \\nWhat can trigger or prevent MS relapses? \\n \\nMany people with MS feel they can identify things that \\nmight trigger a relapse for them. Unfortunately, what \\nappears to affect one person does not always apply to \\nsomeone else, and rese arch has not yet found what \\ntriggers every relapse that people have. This makes it \\nhard to give definite strategies for avoiding relapses \\naltogether. But there is one thing we know that can \\nreduce the number of relapses people get... that is \\ntreatment with  a disease -modifying drug/therapy \\n(DMD/T).  \\n \\nWhat causes exacerbations?  \\n \\nMS relapses are caused by inflammation in the CNS \\nthat damages the myelin coating around nerve fibers . \\nThis damage slows or disrupts the transmission of nerve \\nimpulses and causes the symptoms of MS. In the most \\ncommon disease course in MS, that is RRMS, clearly \\ndefined acute exacerbations are followed by remissions \\nas the inflammatory process gradually co mes to an end. \\nGoing into remission does not necessarily mean that the \\nsymptoms disappear totally. Some people will return to \\nfeeling exactly as they did before the exacerbation \\nbegun, while others may find themselves left with some \\nongoing symptoms. \\n \\nManaging relapses  \\n \\nIt is not possible to predict when relapses will happen or \\nhow often. Every person’s MS is different and so is \\nevery relapse. Some people experience several in a year \\nbut others will go for many years between relapses. As \\nthe number and tim ing of relapses is beyond one's \\ncontrol, the best strategy is to manage them well when \\nthey happen.  \\n \\nRehabilitation  \\n \\nThe goal of a rehabilitation program is to restore or \\nmaintain functions essential to daily living. \\nRehabilitation can be especially usef ul soon after an \\nexacerbation to help one get back on track. The \\nmembers of the rehab team — including physical \\ntherapists, occupational therapists, speech/language \\npathologists, and cognitive remediation specialists — \\naddress problems with mobility, dress ing and personal \\ncare, role performance at home and work, and overall \\nfitness. They also provide evaluation and treatment of \\nspeech, swallowing difficulties, and problems with \\nthinking and memory that may have appeared or \\nworsened during the exacerbation. \\n \\nPseudo-relapses \\n \\nA pseudo -relapse is a worsening of symptoms for a \\nshort time without an increase in MS activity. Pseudo -\\nrelapses are often caused by a rise in body temperature \\nbecause of an illness or infection, exercise, or simply \\nbeing in a hot environment.

If the coating myelin has \\nbeen damaged, this slowing down can make the \\nsymptoms worse, or make old symptoms reappear. \\nThese pseudo -relapses are no t thought to cause long -\\nterm harm. Once whatever is causing the body \\ntemperature to rise has gone away, the symptoms go \\naway too.  \\n \\n \\n \\nAtypical variants of MS have been described. There is a \\ndebate on whether they are MS variants or differ ent \\ndiseases. Some diseases previously considered MS \\nvariants, like Devic\\'s disease (DD), are now considered \\noutside the MS spectrum. Rare and unusual variants of \\nMS include Balo\\'s concentric sclerosis, Marburg\\'s acute \\nMS, Schilder\\'s diffuse sclerosis, and tumefactive MS, as \\nbriefly discussed below.  \\n \\nBalo\\'s concentric sclerosis (BCS) \\n \\nBCS is a demyelinating disease similar to standard MS, \\nbut with the particularity that the demyelinated tissues \\nform concentric layers (Figure 1). The disease was \\ndescribed by József Mátyás Baló who initially named it \\n\"leuko-encephalitis periaxialis concentrica\".  \\n \\nHistorically, however, it was first described by Otto \\nMarburg in 1906. It was only later, in 1928, that Baló  \\nstudied it in a Hungarian patient, showing also \\ndemyelination of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). \\nIt appears to be more common in Chinese and Filipino \\npopulations (both Asiatic) than in caucasians. In BCS, \\nthe white matter of the brain appears damaged  in \\nconcentric layers that can be seen on MRI, leaving the \\naxis cylinder intact.  \\n \\nIt is currently considered one of the borderline forms of \\nMS. Note that the concentric ring appearance is not \\nspecific to BCS as it has also been reported in patients \\nwith n euromyelitis optica (NO), standard MS, \\nprogressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PMLE), \\ncerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy (CADA) with \\nsubcortical infarcts, leukoencephalopathy (LE), \\nconcomitant active hepatitis C, and human herpes virus \\n6 (HHV -6). BCS patients can survive, or even have \\nspontaneous remission and asymptomatic cases.  \\n \\nFigure 1 (a) is the original case of Baló (1928), showing \\nseveral anastomoses located in the lower half of the \\nlesion. Figures 1(b) and (c) depict the lesion centered by \\na veinule showing ring fragmentation in a constrained \\narea, respectively from Hallervorden et al. (1933) and \\nCastaigne et al.

Here, Loyez staining shows \\nmyelin in black and destroyed areas in white (scale \\nbars:1 cm).  \\n \\nMarburg\\'s acute multiple sclerosis (MAMS) \\n \\nMarburg\\'s acute multiple sclerosis (MAMS) (aka \\n\\'Marburg\\'s MS\\', \\'fulminant MS\\', or \\'malignant MS\\') took \\nits name from Otto Marburg. It is considered one of the \\nMS borderline diseases, which is a collection of \\ndiseases classified by some as MS variants and by \\nothers as different diseases. It causes swift and \\nrelentless symptoms and d ecline in function, and can \\nresult in significant disability or even death shortly after \\ndisease onset.  \\n \\nOther diseases in this group are neuromyelitis optica \\n(NMO), Balo\\'s concentric sclerosis (BCS), and \\nSchilder\\'s diffuse sclerosis (SDS) or Schilder\\'s d isease. \\nThe graver course is one form of malignant MS, with \\npatients reaching a significant level of disability in less \\nthan five years from their first symptoms, often in a \\nmatter of months. Sometimes, MAMS is considered a \\nsynonym for tumefactive MS, but not for all authors. \\n \\nSchilder\\'s diffuse myelinoclastic sclerosis (SDMS) \\nSDMS was first described by Paul Ferdinand Schilder \\nin 1912.

In the \\nsecond group, myelin is abnormal and degenerates. \\nSDMS is a very infrequent neurodegenerative disease \\nthat presents clinically as pseudo -tumoral \\ndemyelinating lesions, making its diagnosis difficult. It \\nusually begins in childhood, affecting children between \\n5 and 14 years old, but cases in adults are also possible. \\nSDMS is considered to be one of the borderline forms \\nof MS.  \\n \\nTumefactive multiple sclerosis (TMS) \\n \\nIn TMS, the central nervous system of a p erson has \\nmultiple demyelinating lesions with different \\ncharacteristics from the typical standard MS. It is called \\ntumefactive because the lesions are \"tumor -like\" and \\nmimic tumors clinically, radiologically, and even \\nsometimes pathologically. These atypic al lesion \\ncharacteristics include a large intracranial lesion of size \\ngreater than 2.0 cm with a mass effect, an edema, and \\nan open ring enhancement. The \\'mass effect\\' is the \\neffect of a mass on its surroundings, for example, \\nexerting pressure on the surro unding brain matter; the \\n\\'edema\\' is the build -up of fluid within the brain tissue; \\nand the ring enhancement is directed toward the cortical \\nsurface. \\n \\nNormally a tumefactive demyelinating lesion appears \\ntogether with smaller disseminated lesions separated i n \\ntime and space, yielding a diagnosis of MS. Hence, the \\nname \"tumefactive MS\". When the demyelinating \\nlesion appears alone, it has been termed “solitary \\nsclerosis”. These cases belong to a borderline MS and \\nthere is currently no universal agreement on how  they \\nshould be considered. An initial tumefactive lesion can \\nevolve to various pathological entities: MS (the most \\ncommon), BCS, SDMS, and acute disseminated \\nencephalomyelitis.  \\n \\nTMS cases make up 1 to 2 of every 1000 MS cases. As \\nin general MS, there are  differences for gender, (higher \\npercentage of females affected than males), ethnicity \\n(most common among Caucasians), and geographic \\nlocation (greater incidence at latitudes above 40° as \\ncompared to at the equator). The median age of onset is \\n37 years. While these associations have been made, it is \\nstill unclear how they result in an increased risk of MS \\nonset. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSigns and symptoms of MS may differ greatly from \\nperson to person and also over the course of the disease \\ndepending on the location of the affected nerve fibers \\nand the amount of nerve damage. Further, some people \\nwith severe MS may lose the ability to wal k \\nindependently or at all, while others may experience \\nlong periods of remission without any new symptoms. \\n \\nIn MS, damage to the myelin coating around the nerve \\nfibers in the CNS and to the nerve fibers themselves \\ninterferes with the transmission of nerve signals \\nbetween the brain, spinal cord, and the rest of the body. \\nDisrupted nerve signals cause the symptoms of MS, \\nwhich vary from one person to another and over time \\nfor any given individual, depending on where and when \\nthe damage occurs. A person with M S can have almost \\nany neurological symptom or sign, with autonomic, \\nvisual, motor, and sensory problems being the most \\ncommon. Symptoms may include some or many of the \\nfollowing: Tiredness and weakness, pain and body \\nspasms, vision difficulties, speech dif ficulties, sensation \\ndifficulties, motor difficulties, cognitive difficulties, \\npsychological difficulties, posture difficulties, \\nmetabolic difficulties, and seizures.  \\n \\nMeasure of disability and severity of the disease \\n \\nThe two main measure of disability and severity of MS '),\n",

MS relapses are thought to be \\nassociated with the development of new areas of \\ndamage in the brain. Exacerbati ons are characteristic of \\nrelapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). An exacerbation may \\nbe mild, or severe enough to significantly interfere with \\nlife's daily activities. Most exacerbations last from \\nseveral days to several weeks, although some have \\nlasted for as long as a few months.  \\n \\nProdromal Phase \\n \\nMS may have a prodromal phase in the years leading up \\nto disease manifestation. It is characterized by \\npsychiatric issues, cognitive impairment, and increased \\nutilization of healthcare. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMuch effort has been expended in an attempt to \\naccurately classify the various stages of MS. Clinical \\nrelapses at a younger age, coupled with radiological \\nevidence of CNS inflammation, provide good support \\nfor the earlier RRMS. This may be important  from a \\npractical point of view to guide clinical therapeutic \\ndecisions given the many options for effective anti -\\ninflammatory agents that are currently available. But, \\nwith time, identifying the transition from relapsing to \\nsecondary progressive disease o ften becomes \\nproblematic.  \\n \\nThe absence of clinical relapses does not imply absence \\nof inflammatory activity on MRI, and absence of \\ninflammatory radiological lesions does not imply lack \\nof inflammation at the tissue level. Indeed, it has been \\nproposed that  MS is a condition in which disability \\nprogression is driven in two stages, and early relapsing \\ninflammatory activity has little influence on the second, \\nlater stage of progressive deterioration.  \\n \\nTherefore, identifying the transition to secondary \\nprogression has important practical implications \\nbecause it appears that current anti -inflammatory drugs \\noffer little benefit in the absence of ongoing \\ninflammatory activity. Also, continuing treatment \\nentails expenses and potential risks from potent \\nimmunosuppressants with potentially little benefit in \\nreturn. This is not to say that inflammation disappears at \\nlater stages. Indeed, recent studies show that substantial \\ninflammatory lesion activity persists well into the \\nprogressive phase and, perhaps counterintuit ively, that \\nSPMS and PPMS samples exhibit a higher lesion load \\ncompared with relapsing subjects.  \\n \\nMoreover, there are few differences in lesion \\nmorphology or immunopathology in SPMS versus \\nPPMS brain, even though decades of recurrent \\ninflammatory attack p receded the former.

Such lesions \\nwere recently shown to be important predictors of \\nfuture disability. Interestingly, there is scant \\nlymphocytic activity (B -cells are a peculiar exception). \\nInstead, microglial activation is seen at the borders of \\nexpanding lesions. This suggests that adaptive \\nautoimmunity plays a lesser role at this stage and that \\ninnate responses predominate.  \\n \\nA key question is whether innate immune cells are \\nsomehow dysregulated and become primary drivers of \\ndegeneration, or simply react, as they are expected to, \\nagainst an unidentified primary injury that itself is the \\nunderlying cause of tissue destruction.

If so, why some patients assume a \\nmore relapsing inflammatory pattern at first whereas \\nothers begin later with a progressive course is unclear. \\nHere, the genetic background and the environment \\nlikely play major roles in programming the  various \\nclinical phenotypes without the need to invoke \\nfundamentally different disease mechanisms. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMS is one of the most common causes of neurological \\ndisability in young adults. Its etiology has been \\nintensively investigated for over a century and, although \\nmuch has been discovered about the immunobiology, \\ngenetics, and epidemiology of this disease, the \\nfundamental cause remains a mystery. MS is \\ndistinguishable from most other chronic neurological \\ndisorders by its unique fluctuating course. The majority \\nof patients with MS present with early relapsing and \\nremitting episodes of neurological and radiological \\nworsening followed by varying degrees of recovery \\n(relapsing-remitting MS, or RRMS). In most patients, \\nthis in itial relapsing remitting phase is followed years \\nlater by a more chronic progressive phase (secondary \\nprogressive MS, or SPMS), whereas a min ority (≈15%) \\nof patients begin with a progressive course from onset \\n(primary progressive MS, or PPMS) for unknown \\nreasons. \\n \\nOn the etiology of MS \\n \\nMS involves the CNS (brain and spinal cord) or the \\noptic nerves. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) and \\nthe long nerves to the body and limbs are unaffected. \\nThere is evidence of an immune reaction manifesting as \\npatches or plaques of inflammation showing swelling of \\ntissue, breakdown and loss of myelin surrounding the \\nnerve fibers, and some damage to the nerve fibers or \\naxons themselves. As healing occurs, some scar of \\ntissue can form in the area. There may be many such \\nscars or lesions widely distributed in the CNS (from \\nwhich the name of the disease derives). In addition, \\nimmune cells (T, B, and macrophages) are present in the \\nlesions. The major questions are:  \\n \\nWhat initiates the immune reaction to myelin? This is \\nthe more so as the CNS is normally “immune privileged” \\nand immune cells usually remain in the bloodstream \\noutside of the CNS. In MS, however, such cells become \\nactivated against myelin and are able to penetrate the \\nblood-brain barrier (BBB), triggering a further  complex \\nprocess of immune mediated damage of myelin and \\nunderlying nerve fibers.  \\n \\nWhat is it in the myelin that the immune reaction is \\ndirected toward?  Studies have not shown that there is \\nanything distinctly different about the basic structure of \\nmyelin in a person with MS.  \\n \\nAre the plaques of inflammation in the white matter \\nthe only affected areas?  Sophisticated MRI and \\npathological studies have shown that brain areas that \\nappear normal are actually not entirely normal and \\nshow subtle inflammation cha nges as well. There are \\nalso changes in the grey matter area. In other words, \\nMS is more widespread than normally seen from the \\npatches viewed on MRI. \\n \\nTraditional “outside-in” autoimmune model  \\nTraditionally, the etiology of MS was based on an \\n“outside-in” autoimmune hypothesis whereby \\ndysregulated auto-reactive T-cells in the periphery cross \\ninto the CNS parenchyma and, together with \\nmacrophages and B -cells, proceed to attack various \\nCNS elements, where myelin is a prominent target. \\nThese inflammatory eve nts, resulting in a relapsing -\\nremitting clinical course, likely contribute '),\n",

Initial malfunction occurs \\nwithin the CNS, as suspected for other \\nneurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) such as \\nAlzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s diseases (PD). This \\nalternative “inside -out” hypothesis argues that MS is a \\nprimary degenerative disease accompanied by varying \\ndegrees of inflammation, leading to the release of \\nantigenic cell components such as myelin \\noligodendrocyte glycoprotein, myelin basic protein, and \\nproteolipid protein. This chronic shedding of auto -\\nantigens secondarily promotes an autoimmune \\ninflammatory response in the predisposed host, in turn \\ndriving additional degeneration in a vicious cycle.  \\n \\nMS typical progression \\n \\nUsually a chronic recurring illness, MS typically begins \\nwith 1-mm to 3-cm patches of inflammation developing \\nin the oligodendrocyte -generated myelin sheaths of \\nCNS axons. T-cell-mediated inflammation strips myelin \\nfrom (demyelinates) ax ons and eventually leaves \\nsclerotic (Greek, sklerosis, hard) plaques scattered \\nthroughout the CNS. Plaques disseminated throughout \\nthe myelin or “white matter” of the cerebrum, \\ncerebellum, spinal cord, ocular motility system, and \\noptic nerves constitute the signature of MS.  \\n \\nWhen deprived of their myelin insulation, axons \\ntransmit nerve impulses slowly or not at all. Some \\ndeficits resolve as myelin inflammation spontaneously \\nsubsides or anti -inflammatory medications, such as \\nsteroids, suppress it. As plaqu es recur, develop in new \\nareas, and accumulate, MS evolves from an acute \\ninflammatory to a chronic degenerative condition. \\nSooner or later the plaques leave permanent neurologic \\ndeficits.  \\n \\nAlthough MS acts primarily as a CNS demyelinating \\ndisorder, its pa thology includes prominent axon \\ndegeneration. In contrast to demyelination associated \\nwith plaques, axon degeneration regularly produces \\npermanent mental and physical disabilities.  \\n \\nThe illness’ mean age of onset is 33 years, with 70% of \\ncases developing between ages 21 and 40 years. Some \\nstudies have reported that many patients suffered their \\nfirst or a subsequent MS attack after a medical insult, \\nsuch as infection, childbirth, head or spine trauma, \\nintervertebral disk surgery, or electrical injury. Other  \\nstudies have reported that psychologic stress preceded \\nthe first MS or subsequent attacks. However, most \\ncarefully controlled prospective studies have shown that \\nthese insults do not play a major role in either causing \\nor exacerbating MS. Thus, the cause of MS remains \\nunknown.

Myelin can be \\ncompared to the insulation -coating on electrical wires. \\nWhen the protective myelin is damaged and the nerve \\nfiber is exposed, the messages that travel along that \\nnerve fiber may be slowed or blocked. It is not clear \\nwhy MS develops in some people and not others. A \\ncombination of genetics, environmental, and lifestyle \\nfactors appears to be responsible. Remember, however, \\nthat “risk is not causation”.  \\n \\n \\n \\nThe three main characteristics of MS are the formation \\nof lesions (also called “plaques”) in the CNS, \\ninflammation, and the destruction of myelin sheaths of \\nneurons (acronym LIM). These features interact in a \\ncomplex and not yet fully understood manner to \\nproduce the breakdown of nerve tissue and, in turn, the \\nsigns and symptoms of the disease. Cholesterol crystals \\nare also believed both to impair myelin repair and to \\naggravate inflammation.  \\n \\nLesions \\n \\nThe name multiple sclerosis refers to the scars (sclera e \\n– better known as \\'plaques\\' or \\'lesions\\') that form in the \\nnervous system. These lesions most commonly affect \\nthe white matter in the optic nerve, the brain stem, the \\nbasal ganglia, and the spinal cord, or the white matter \\ntracts close to the lateral ven tricles. The function of \\nwhite matter cells is to carry signals between grey \\nmatter areas, where the processing is done, and the rest \\nof the body. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is \\nrarely involved. \\n \\nSpecifically, MS involves the loss of oligodendrocyt es, \\nthe cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty \\nlayer (the myelin sheath), which helps the neurons carry \\nelectrical signals (called “action potentials”). This \\nresults in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and, as \\nthe disease advances, the  breakdown of the axons of \\nneurons. When the myelin is lost, a neuron can no \\nlonger effectively conduct electrical signals. A repair \\nprocess, called “remyelination”, takes place in the early \\nphases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes are \\nunable to com pletely rebuild the cell\\'s myelin sheath. \\nRepeated attacks lead to successively less effective \\nremyelinations, until a scar -like plaque is built up \\naround the damaged axons. These scars are the origin of \\nthe symptoms. During an attack, MRI often shows more  \\nthan ten new plaques. This could indicate that there are \\na number of lesions below which the brain is capable of \\nrepairing itself without producing noticeable \\nconsequences. Another process involved in the creation \\nof lesions is an abnormal increase in the  number of \\nastrocytes due to the destruction of nearby neurons. A \\nnumber of lesion patterns have been described in the \\nscientific literature. \\n \\nInflammation \\n \\nApart from demyelination, the other sign of the disease \\nis inflammation that develops along the following \\nprocess. T -cells (kind of lymphocytes that play an \\nimportant role in the body\\'s defenses) gain entry into \\nthe brain via disruptions in the blood –brain barrier \\n(BBB), recognize myelin as foreign, and attack it. These \\ncells are also called \"autoreactive lymphocytes\". \\n \\nDestruction of neuronal myelin sheaths \\n \\nThe attack on myelin starts inflammatory processes, \\nwhich trigger other immune cells and the releas e of \\nsoluble factors like cytokines and antibodies. In turn, a \\nfurther breakdown of the BBB causes a number of other \\ndamaging effects such as swelling, activation of \\nmacrophages, and more activation of cytokines and \\nother destructive proteins. Inflammation  can potentially \\nreduce transmission of information between neurons in \\nat least three ways. The soluble factors released might \\nstop neurotransmission by intact neurons. These factors \\ncould lead to or enhance the loss of myelin or, else, may \\ncause the axon to break down completely. \\n '),\n",

Anti -MOG autoantibodies were found to be \\nalso present in ADEM, and a second spectrum of \\nseparated diseases is being considered.

Re cent studies have shown that \\ncortical and deep grey matter lesions in the thalamus, \\ncaudate, putamen, and cerebellar cortex during the early \\nstage of disease are independent of white matter \\npathology. These recent findings strongly support the \\nhypothesis p roposed a decade ago that \\nneurodegeneration becomes independent of \\ninflammation during progressive MS and MS could be a \\nprimary degenerative disease.  \\n \\nIn support of the finding that neurodegeneration during \\nMS is independent of inflammation, it was recent ly \\nreported that inflammatory relapses are associated with \\ntransient short-term disability, but long -term worsening \\nwas largely independent of relapses. The concept of \\n“silent progression” was proposed, consistent with an \\nunderlying degenerative process pr oceeding largely \\nindependently of autoimmune inflammation. The age \\nand gender differences between relapse -onset MS \\n(ROMS) (younger age at onset and greater prevalence \\nin women) and primary progressive MS (PPMS) (later \\nage at onset and equal prevalence amon g the sexes) do \\nnot necessarily imply a fundamentally different etiology. \\nSuch differences can be readily explained by the known \\ndifference in autoimmune predilection which is greater \\nin women. A person afflicted with the same underlying \\ncytodegeneration, but more prone to react with an \\ninflammatory lesion, would naturally present earlier \\ninflammatory lesions in more obvious clinical disability. \\nAs age and accompanying immune senescence progress, \\nMS at later ages would be expected to exhibit less \\ninflammation. \\n \\nIn contrast to relapsing -remitting MS (RRMS), which \\nhas major involvement of peripheral immune cell \\ninfiltration in actively demyelinating plaques, \\nprogressive MS may involve the development of \\ncompartmentalized pathological processes within the \\nresident CNS cells. Microglia are the most abundant \\nresident macrophage -like cells in the CNS and \\nconstitute one of the key cell types that could trigger \\nneurotoxic pathways leading to progressive \\nneurodegeneration or, in contrast, could exert important \\nroles i n promoting neuroprotection, downregulation of \\ninflammation, and stimulation of repair. Activated \\nmicroglia exhibit cytoplasmic hypertrophy, retraction of \\nprocesses, and upregulation of MHC class II molecules \\nand pro-inflammatory cytokines.  \\n \\nNot only is m icroglial activation observed in early \\nactive lesions, it also accompanies diffuse axonal injury \\nin normal -appearing white and grey matter of \\nprogressive MS lesions. In addition, microglial nodules \\n(a clustering of activated microglia) are abundant in the \\nareas adjacent to plaques, particularly in patients with \\nprogressive MS. In an attempt to understand the \\nneuropathological processes occurring in progressive \\nMS, a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging \\nmethod with radioligands binding to the 18 -kDa \\ntranslocator protein (TSPO) molecule on activated \\nmicroglia was developed for monitoring these cells in \\nliving patients with MS. It revealed that TSPO binding \\nwas significantly increased in the normal -appearing \\nwhite matter (NAWM) of patients with secondary \\nprogressive MS (SPMS) but only modestly in the \\nNAWM of RRMS brain. In PPMS, such studies are still \\nlimited. Most recently, TSPO -PET studies showed \\nsignificantly increased signals in subcortical grey matter \\nregions, especially in the thalamus in SPMS, and t his \\nwas associated with accelerated brain atrophy. Thus, \\nactivated microglia are observed in progressive MS; \\nhowever, what is not yet known is whether they \\ncontribute to ongoing degeneration or reflect a normal \\nreaction to injury and serve a protective role. \\n \\nMitochondrial dysfunction in MS \\n \\nMitochondria play a central role in the supply of energy \\nto electrically active axons and neurons.

Genetic studies on pa tients with \\nPPMS are less comprehensive because of the much \\nlower incidence of this MS phenotype. However, \\ndespite the striking difference in clinical phenotypes \\nbetween ROMS and PPMS, clear genetic differences \\nhave not emerged. Interestingly, however, MS patients \\nexhibiting a higher degree of neurodegeneration had \\nvariants in genes related to glutamate signaling, \\nsupporting the concept of a neurodegenerative underlay \\ndriven at least in part by “chronic excitotoxicity”.  \\n \\nMoreover, such chronic excitotoxici ty is likely further \\nexacerbated by glutamate released by immune cells. \\nFinally, it was recently shown that primary myelin \\ndamage is a strong trigger for a secondary immune \\nreaction driven in large part by biochemically altered \\nmyelin proteins; it is quite  likely that chronic \\nexcitotoxicity, originating from both the as -yet-\\nunknown underlying degenerative process(es) and \\nglutamate release from infiltrating immune cells, \\npromotes a persistent source of pathological myelin \\nproducts resulting in a vicious cycl e of degeneration –\\ninflammation–more degeneration.  \\n \\nTaken together, data so far unequivocally support the \\ncontribution of multiple immune -related genetic loci to \\nRRMS, but a direct causal relationship remains elusive. \\nOne could also argue that studies of M S genetics \\nprovide information on host susceptibility and response \\nto some causative factor that nonetheless remains \\nunknown. By extension, elucidating multiple immune -\\nrelated genetic loci associated with MS may not bring \\nus any closer to identifying the root cause.  \\n \\nIn addition to immunogenetics, MS risk is strongly \\nassociated with environmental factors, in particular \\ninfection with Epstein –Barr virus (EBV), sun \\nexposure/vitamin D deficiency, and smoking. \\nEnvironmental factors \\n \\nEnvironmental factors, in particular during childhood, \\nmay perhaps play a role such as, for example, an \\nenvironmental toxin or even a dietary imbalance. \\nHowever, there is no related convincing evidence.  On \\nthe other hand, several studies found that people who \\nmove to a different region of the world before the age of \\n15 acquire the new region's risk of MS. Whatever factor \\nis involved, it would have to have taken place before \\nthe approximate age of 15 for the disease process to be \\ntriggered later in life. If migration takes place afte r age \\n15, however, the person retains the risk of their home \\ncountry. However, there is some evidence that the effect \\nof moving may still apply to people older than 15. \\n \\nGeographical factors \\n \\nMS is more common in people who live farther from \\nthe equator, although exceptions exist.

Two opposing \\nversions of this hypothesis include the “hygiene \\nhypothesis” and the “prevalence hypothesis”, the \\nformer being more favored. The hygiene hypothesis \\nproposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early \\nin life is protective, the disease being a response to a \\nlate encounter with such agents. The prevalen ce \\nhypothesis proposes that an early, persistent, and silent \\ninfection increases the risk of disease, and thus the \\ndisease is more common where the infectious agent is \\nmore common. Only in a few cases and after many \\nyears does it cause demyelination. \\n \\nSome infections, for example a bladder infection, may \\nalso make a relapse more likely. For this reason, people \\nwith MS are encouraged to treat infections early and to \\navoid things that can cause them. That is why they are \\nadvised to have an annual flu jab, for  example. While \\nsupporting evidence has not been found, the bacterium \\nChlamydiae pneumoniae, responsible for walking \\npneumonia has not been substantiated. \\n \\nViruses \\n \\nA variety of viruses have been invoked as the cause of \\nMS. Searches for such viruses are go ing on, especially \\nas technology has advanced for their detection. For \\nexample, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis can \\ndetect the presence of protein footprints in blood, CSF, \\nand even tissue even if whole viruses cannot be seen. \\nUnfortunately, suppo rting evidence for viral etiology \\nhas not yet been found. \\n \\nA few suspect viruses remain and are under \\ninvestigation. Evidence for a virus as a cause of MS \\nincludes the presence of oligoclonal bands in the brain \\nand the CSF of most people with MS, the assoc iation of \\nseveral viruses with human  demyelinating \\nencephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination \\nin animals caused by some viral infections.  \\n \\nHuman herpes viruses (HHVs) are a candidate group of \\nviruses. (HHV-6 is a common virus that causes roseo la \\nin infants.) Individuals having never been infected by \\nthe Epstein –Barr virus (EBV) are at a reduced risk of \\ngetting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are \\nat a greater risk than those having had it at a younger \\nage. Although some consider that this goes against the \\nhygiene hypothesis, since the non -infected have \\nprobably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, \\nothers believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a \\nfirst encounter with the causative virus relatively late in \\nlife that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that \\nmay be related include measles, mumps, and rubella. \\n \\nSeveral viruses have been found in people with MS, but \\nthe virus most consistently linked to the development of \\nMS is EBV (the virus which causes infectious \\nmononucleosis). It infects approximately 95% of adults \\nand has been increasingly suspected to be the primary \\ncause of MS, even though only a small proportion of \\nthose infected with EBV will later develop MS. Past \\nEBV exposure as evidenced by seropositivity  to the \\nvirus is virtually a prerequisite for developing MS. \\nHowever, given the very high global prevalence of EBV \\nexposure, clearly the converse is not true, i.e., only a \\nsmall minority of exposed individuals will develop MS, \\nindicating that EBV may be ne cessary but not sufficient \\nto trigger the disease.  \\n \\nEpidemiological evidence supporting the important role \\nof this virus includes observations that patients with a \\nhistory of symptomatic EBV infection carry a higher \\nrisk of developing MS, and the risk of MS dramatically '),\n",

A possible explanation for this \\ndiscrepancy is that EBV is one of many possible \\ntriggers of secondary autoimmune response or that EBV \\nalone is not sufficient. Althou gh there is no consensus \\nregarding a direct role of EBV -infected B -cells as a \\nprimary cause of MS, increasing evidence, including \\ntherapeutic strategies, indicates a potentially important \\nrole in MS pathogenesis.  \\n \\nFor instance, recently, a preliminary cli nical trial of \\nautologous EBV-specific T-cell therapy showed clinical \\nimprovement in patients with progressive MS. Although \\nonly 10 subjects underwent treatment, this small study \\nprovides some of the most direct evidence to date of a \\npotentially central ro le of EBV-infected B cells in MS. \\nMoreover, the fact that patients in the progressive phase \\n(a phase largely resistant to current therapies) \\nexperienced improvement is equally noteworthy. \\nWhether the beneficial effects of T-cell mediated killing \\nof EBV -infected B -cells were due to a reduction of \\ndisease-causing immunoglobulin production, or of other \\ntoxic soluble factors produced by B -cells, remains to be \\nseen. A hypothesized mechanism of EBV causing MS is \\nmolecular mimicry between EBV proteins and nervous \\nsystem molecules, causing autoimmunity \\n \\nOnly about 5% of the population has not been infected \\nby EBV . These individuals are at a lower risk for \\ndeveloping MS than those who have been infected. \\nPeople who were infected with EBV in adolescence or \\nadulthood a nd who therefore develop an exaggerated \\nimmune response to EBV are at a significantly higher \\nrisk for developing MS than those who were infected in \\nearly childhood. This suggests that it may be the type of \\nimmune response to EBV that may lead to MS, rather  \\nthan EBV infection itself. However, there is still no \\nproof that EBV causes MS and the mechanisms that \\nunderlie this process are poorly understood. \\n \\nRather than focusing on a single infectious agent, many \\nscientists believe that people with MS have a \\nheightened immune antibody response against a host of \\ncommon and uncommon viruses and other infectious \\nagents and that past claims based on antibody responses \\nagainst a specific agent are likely misleading.  \\n \\nLifestyle factors \\nVitamin D supplementation \\n \\nHaving low levels of vitamin D and low exposure to \\nsunlight is associated with a greater risk of certain \\nautoimmune diseases. Some (not all) studies show that \\nbeing low in vitamin D is linked to having more \\nrelapses. They also showed that getting extra vitamin D  \\nreduced the number of relapses. Several studies indicate \\nthat people who spend more time in the sun and those \\nwith relatively higher levels of vitamin D are less likely \\nto develop MS or have a less severe course of disease \\nand fewer relapses. Bright sunli ght helps human skin \\nproduce vitamin D. Researchers believe that vitamin D \\nmay help regulate the immune system in ways that \\nreduce the risk of MS or autoimmunity in general. \\nPeople from regions near the equator, where there is a \\ngreat deal of bright sunlig ht, generally have a much \\nlower risk of MS than people from temperate areas such \\nas the United States and Canada. \\n \\nVitamin D supplementation in people with MS appears \\nto be safe but at high doses can lead to changes in \\ncalcium levels. More research is need ed to determine \\nwhether it is truly beneficial. A connection between \\nvitamin D and MS could be tied to the positive effects \\nvitamin D has on the immune system.

That is \\nbecause smoking makes one more prone to infections \\n(of the chest or lungs, but also colds and flu), and these \\ncan trigger a relapse. Smoking also stops some DMD/Ts \\nfrom working as they should.  Smoking while on some \\nDMD/Ts increases the chance of a relapse compared to \\npeople on the same drug who do not smoke.

Recent \\nsuccessful therapies have been directed to the \\nB-cells. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 In individuals without MS, circulation of T -\\ncells in the bloodstream is separated from \\nthe CNS by the BBB:  By contrast, in people \\nwith MS, the BBB is breached allowing the \\nimmune cells to move into the CNS tissue and \\ninitiate damage. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Pro-inflammatory cells are overrepresented \\nand mediator cells are under -represented: \\nIn individuals with MS, there is an over -\\nrepresentaion of cells and other immune cell \\ncomponents that enhance immune reponses \\nand an under -representation of immune \\nmediators (anti-inflammatory cells).  \\n \\nUse of laboratory animal models \\n \\nThe actual proof of autoimmunity requires that immune \\nsystem c ells that cause damage in one MS patient be \\ninjected into a different healthy patient and cause \\ndamage and disease there as well. Unfortunately, such \\nan experiment would be unthical and unacceptable \\nbecause it would cause an autoimmune disease in an \\notherwise healthy individual. However, such an \\nexperiment can be, and has been conducted in animal \\nmodels with a disease called experimental allergic (or \\nautoimmune) encephalomyelitis (EAE). The model \\nmimics the changes in MS. It has shown that an \\nautoimmune dis ease can produce similar changes seen \\nin MS lesions. Such an esperiment has also provided a \\n\"proof of concept\" for new immune modulatory \\ndrugs/therapies that might be used in humans with MS. \\n \\n \\n \\nMS is a complex disease for which there is no kn own \\nsingle initiating cause. It is likely the result of several \\ncontributing factors. While the symptoms come from \\nthe nervous system, the cause appears to be a disease of \\nimmune system function, most likely an autoimmune \\ndisease that attacks the central n ervous system ... \\nanother illustration of the adage \"symptoms, \\ncorrelations., associations, and the likes ...are not \\ncausation\". The disease is not genetically inherited \\nalthough there is genetic susceptibility without \\nnecessarily contracting the disease. While one, several \\nor a combination of triggering factors are suspected, \\nsuch as bacteria, viruses (including the Epstein -Barr \\nvirus), or other environmental or lifestyle factors, so far, \\nnone have been found or identified.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nGeneral  \\n \\n1.

It is a differential diagnosis. It may \\nbe important to distinguish between a clinically -isolated \\nsyndrome and MS. In this article, I review the diagnosis \\nprocess in its several componen ts and discuss the \\nMcDonald's diagnostic criteria and their several \\nrevisions. I also present newer diagnostic tools \\nincluding the McArdle's sign and an antibody test that \\nmeasures immunoglobulin kappa free light chains. I \\nsystematically discuss the manage ment of eighteen \\nspecific MS symptoms as well as the management of \\nthe disease per se. Lastly, I elaborate on the self -\\nmanagement of the disease including the management \\nof co-morbidities. \\n \\n \\nBON: Bilateral ON; CBT: Cognitive behavioral therapy; \\nCDMS: Clinically -definite MS; CRT: Cognitive \\nrehabilitation therapy; CDMS: Clinically -definite MS: \\nCIS: Clinically -isolated syndrome; CNS: Central \\nnervous system; CSF: Cerebrospinal fluid; CVS: \\nCentral vein signs; DID: Dissemination in space; DIT: \\nDissemination in time; DMD/T: Disease -modifying \\ndrug/therapy; EDSS: Expanded Disability Status Scale; \\nIgκ: Immunoglobulin κ; JCV: John Cunningham virus; \\nLCFA: Long-chain fatty acids; LETM: Longitudinally \\nextensive transverse myelitis; MOG: Myelin \\noligodendrocyte glycoprotein; MOGAD: MOG \\nantibody-associated disease; MRI: Magnetic resonance \\nimaging; MS: Multiple sclerosis; NMO: Neuromyelitis \\noptica; NMOSD: NMO spectrum disorder; ON: Optic \\nneuritis; PML: Progressiv e multifoal \\nleukoencephalopathy; PMS: Progressive MS; PPMS: \\nPrimary progressive MS; RRMS: Relapsing -remitting \\nMS; SPMS: Secondary progressive MS.

A range of other possible causes \\nneed to be explored and many different tests need to be \\ncarried out. \\n \\nNeurologists base the diagnosis on repeated neurologic \\nsymptoms and signs disseminated in both space and \\ntime. They use recently d eveloped diagnostic criteria \\ntaking advantage of significant advances in radiological \\nimaging. These criteria, named for the senior member \\nof an international panel, Dr. W. Ian McDonald, are the \\nmost commonly used method of diagnosis with the \\nPoser and the older Schumacher criteria being of mostly \\nhistorical significance. They rely on the number and \\nlocation of MRI lesions as well as the number of attacks. \\nNeurologists also use certain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \\nfindings and evoked potentials (see later) to support a \\ndiagnosis. Nonetheless, despite the above exhaustive \\napproach, MS is commonly misdiagnosed due to the \\nlack of clinical signs and MRI findings specific to the \\ndisease. \\n \\nThe diagnosis of MS requires evidence of at least two \\nareas of damage in the C NS, which have occurred at \\ndifferent times. Still maintaining a high sensitivity and \\nspecificity, neurologists now diagnose MS during its \\nfirst episode. They can institute therapy and blunt, \\nalthough not halt, the illness early in its course. Using \\ncurrent criteria also allows neurologists to follow \\npatients’ subclinical as well as clinical progression and \\nmonitor their response to treatment. Before proceeding \\nwith the issues surrounding the diagnosis -making, it \\nmay be important to distinguish between a cli nically-\\nisolated syndrome (CIS) and MS.   \\n \\n \\n \\nCIS refers to a first episode of neurologic \\nsymptoms that lasts at least 24 hours and is caused by \\ninflammation or demyelination in the CNS. It can be \\neither monofocal or multifocal. In the former episode, \\nthe person experiences a single neurologic sign or \\nsymptom (for example, an attack of optic neuritis, ON) \\nthat is caused by a single lesion. In the latter episode, \\nthe person experiences more than one sign or symptom \\n(for example, an ON attack accompanied by numbness \\nor tingling in the legs) caused by lesions in more than \\none place. It usually has no associated fever or infection \\nand is followed by a complete or partial recovery. \\n \\nHow is CIS different from MS? \\nBased upon clinical symptoms alone, CIS and MS may \\nappear to be the same. In both, demyelination (damage \\nto the myelin sheath) interferes with the way nerve \\nimpulses are carried from the brain, resulting in \\nneurologic symptoms. By definition, a person with  CIS \\nis experiencing the first episode of symptoms caused \\nby inflammation and demyelination in the CNS. On the \\nother hand, a person with MS has experienced more \\nthan one episode. With CIS, an MRI may demonstrate \\ndamage only in the area responsible for the current \\nsymptoms. By contrast, with MS, there may be \\nmultiple lesions on MRI in different areas of the brain. \\nAccording to the 2017 revisions to the diagnostic \\ncriteria for MS (see below), the diagnosis of MS can be \\nmade when CIS is accompanied by MRI find ings (old \\nlesions or scars) that confirm that an earlier episode of \\ndamage occurred in a different location in the CNS. \\nThe new criteria also allow for the presence of \\noligoclonal bands in a person's CSF to help make the \\ndiagnosis. As MRI technology becomes more advanced, \\nit is likely that the diagnosis of MS will be made more \\nquickly and there will be fewer people diagnosed with \"),\n",

In diagnosing CIS, two chal lenges \\npresent themselves, namely (1) whether the person is \\nexperiencing a neurologic episode caused by damage \\nin the CNS and (2) determining the likelihood that this \\ndemyelinating event will develop MS. \\n \\nRisk of developing MS \\n \\nThere is a risk spectrum of developing MS, \\nincluding: \\n \\n• High risk of developing MS: When CIS is \\naccompanied by MRI -detected brain lesions that are \\nsimilar to those seen in MS, the person has a 60% -80% \\nchance of a second neurologic event and diagnosis of \\nMS within several years. \\n \\n• Low risk of developing MS: When CIS is not \\naccompanied by MRI -detected brain lesions, the \\nperson has about a 20% chance of developing MS over \\nthe same period of time. \\n \\nAn accurate diagnosis at this time is important because \\npeople with a high risk of develo ping MS are \\nencouraged to begin treatment with a disease -\\nmodifying drug/therapy (DMD/T) in order to delay or \\nprevent a second neurologic episode and, therefore, the \\nonset of MS. In addition, early treatment may minimize \\nfuture disability caused by further inflammation and \\ndamage to nerve cells, which are sometimes silent \\n(occurring without any noticeable symptoms). Several \\nmedications have an FDA indication for CIS (Avonex®, \\nBetaseron®, Extavia® and Mayzent®). \\n \\nWho gets a CIS and when? \\nLike MS, CIS is not d irectly inherited, and it is not \\ncontagious. CIS is two - to three - times more common \\nin women than men. Seventy percent of people \\ndiagnosed with CIS are between the ages of 20 and 40 \\nyears (average 30 years), but people can develop CIS at \\nolder or younger ages. \\n \\n \\n \\nMS is complex and difficult to arrive at because it can \\ncause many different symptoms. It is hard to pinpoint \\nexactly when it begins, but the early signs and \\nsymptoms are different for everyone. It is not \\nuncommon for a diagnosis to take several months and  \\nmay even take longer. A range of other possible causes \\nneed to be explored and many different tests need to be \\ncarried out.  \\n \\nAs of 2017, there is no single test (including biopsy) \\nthat can provide a definitive diagnosis of MS. Brain \\nand spine MRI may show areas of demyelination \\n(lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered \\nintravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active \\nplaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence \\nof historical lesions not associated with symptoms at \\nthe moment of the evaluation. \\n \\nIn addition to brain atrophy seen in MRI, central vein \\nsigns (CVS) have also been proposed as a good \\nindicator of MS in comparison with other conditions \\ncausing white lesions. One small study found fewer \\nCVS in older and hypertensive people. Further research \\non CVS as a biomarker for MS is ongoing. \\n \\nTesting obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide \\nevidence of chronic inflammation in the CNS. The \\nfluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on \\nelectrophoresis, which are inflammation mar kers found \\nin 75%–85% of people with MS. \\n \\nLacking specific tests, the diagnosis often relies on \\nruling-out other conditions that might produce similar \\nsigns and symptoms – this is known as a 'differential \\ndiagnosis'. There are several diseases that present  \\nsimilarly to MS such as: intractable vomiting; severe \"),\n",

Involvement of \\nmultiple cranial nerves raises suspicion for \\nneurosarcoidosis. Longitudinally extensive transverse \\nmyelitis (LETM), in which spinal cord damage spans \\nthree or more vertebral segments, raises suspicion for \\nNMOSD, neurosarcoidosis,  anti-MOG–associated \\nmyelitis, systemic rheumatologic disease, or a \\nparaneoplastic disorder. \\n \\nIn most people with relapsing -remitting MS (RRMS), \\nthe diagnosis is fairly straightforward; it is based on a \\npattern of symptoms consistent with the disease and \\nconfirmed by brain MRI imaging scans. Diagnosing \\ncan be more difficult in people with unusual symptoms \\nor progressive disease. I n the latter cases, further \\ntesting with spinal fluid analysis, evoked potentials, \\nand additional imaging may be needed. The process \\nfollows the following steps: \\n \\n• Medical history: It may be the most important of the \\nexamination. It includes the story of the symptoms and \\ncomplaints, and the general life time health including \\noperations and accidents, illnesses in the family, \\noccupational information, and other details. \\n \\n• General and neurological examination:  Here, the \\nneurologist may carry out a general p hysical \\nexamination (lungs, heart, blood pressure, muscles and \\nskin) and a neurological examination (simple tests for \\nbalance, movement, coordination, reflexes, vision, \\nattention span, speech, swallowing, sense of touch, \\nmemory and thinking, and bowel and bladder function). \\nThereafter, some or all of the following tests may be \\nrecommended. \\n \\n• Laboratory blood tests:  They help rule out other \\ndiseases with symptoms similar to MS. Tests to check \\nfor specific biomarkers associated with MS are \\ncurrently under de velopment and may also aid in \\ndiagnosing the disease. \\n \\n• Lumbar puncture (spinal tap):  Under local \\nanesthetic, a needle is inserted in the lower back into \\nthe space around the spinal cord. It collects a small \\nsample of fluid, which is then tested in the la boratory \\nto examine certain proteins for the presence of \\noligoclonal bands, abnormalities, and the presence of \\nantibodies associated with MS. It can help rule -out \\ninfections and other conditions with symptoms similar \\nto MS. It can also show abnormalities in antibodies that \\nare associated with MS. The lumbar puncture can leave \\nthe patient with a headache for a few days.    \\n \\n• MRI: A machine called an MRI scanner uses \\nmagnetic fields and radio waves to build up an inside \\npicture of the brain and spinal cord. These pictures \\n(scans) create images of cross -sections of the brain and \\nspinal cord. Any lesions (areas of damage and scarring) \\nthat show up on the scan can reveal inflammation, \\ndamage to the myelin surrounding the nerves, and scars \\n(or lesions) that may be caused by MS. The test may \\nrequire an intravenous injection of a contrast material \\nto highlight those lesions that indicate if the disease is \\nin an active phase. Brain atrophy, also revealed by the \\nMRI scan, is seen as an indicator of MS. MRI has \\nbecome the most accurate and helpful test for MS. \\nNonetheless, it is important to remember that MRI \\ndoes not show MS, only changes th at could be due to \\nMS. Further, MRI does not indicate the state of the \\ndisease (mild, advanced, getting worse, less \\ninflammatory changes such as those in the grey matter \\nor in areas that appear normal). For those patients who \\nmight experience anxiety, mild  sedation can be \\nadministered such as Lorazepam (Ativan) or Diazepam \\n(Valium). \\n \\n• Evoked potential tests: These tests measure how fast \\nmessages go from the brain to the eyes, ears, and skin. \\nThey record the electrical signals produc ed by the \\nnervous system in response to stimuli. The tests may \\nuse visual or electrical stimuli. They measure the rate \\nand form of the impulses as they pass through specific \\nnerves. One watches a moving visual pattern, or short '),\n",

Electrodes measure how quickly the information \\ntravels down the nerve pathways. Thus, to measure \\nvision, patterns are shown on a screen. Small pads are \\nplaced on the head to measure how the brain reacts to \\nwhat one sees.  To test hearing, the patient listens to \\nclicks through headphones. Another test measures how \\nfast muscles react following tiny shocks on the skin \\nthat feel like ‘pins and needles. Reactions are usually \\nslower if MS has damaged the myelin around nerves \\nthat control the body parts being tested. \\n \\n• “Hot bath” test:  Many years ago, to diagnose MS, a \\nperson suspected of having the disease was immersed \\nin a hot tub of water. The appearance of or worsening \\nneurologic symptoms was taken as evidence the person \\nhad MS. \\n \\nDiagnosing primary progressive MS (PPMS) \\n \\nTo diagnose PPMS, the patient should not have had \\nany relapses and the disability must have worsened \\nover at least a year. \\n \\n• MRI scan: The scan must show two or more lesions \\nin different parts of the brain o r spinal cord. These \\nmust have happened at different times.  \\n \\n• Lumbar puncture:  It must also show signs of MS \\n(antibodies) in the cerebrospinal fluid. \\n \\nDiagnosing secondary progressive MS (SPMS) \\n \\nTo diagnose SPMS, the patient must have had relapses \\nin the  past, with a steady increase in disability for at \\nleast six months that is not linked to any relapse. The \\nExpanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), discussed in \\narticle I in this series, can be used to measure disability \\nand track if it is getting worse. \\n \\nThe McDonald\\'s diagnosis criteria \\nProposed in 2001, these criteria have been revised in \\n2005, 2010, and 2017. For a diagnosis, they propose \\neither of the following alternatives: \"MS\", \"possible \\nMS\", or \"not MS\". They maintained a sc heme for \\ndiagnosing MS based solely on clinical grounds but \\nalso proposed for the first time that, when clinical \\nevidence is lacking, MRI findings can serve as \\nsurrogates for dissemination in space (DIS) and/or time \\n(DIT) to diagnose MS. To prove the exist ence of \\ndemyelinating lesions, by image or by their effects, \\nMRI should show lesions in different areas of the \\nnervous system (DIS) and that they accumulate over \\ntime (DIT). They facilitate the diagnosis of MS in \\npatients who present with their first demye linating \\nattack and significantly increase the sensitivity for \\ndiagnosing MS without compromising the specificity \\n(Table 1).\\n \\nClinical presentation Additional data needed \\n\\uf0b7 2 or more attacks (relapses) \\n\\uf0b7 2 or more objective clinical lesions \\n\\uf0b7 None.

If that possibility is \\nborne out, McArdle\\'s sign might potentially help \\nidentify patients who would benefit from treatment \\nwith conduction -enhancing medications such as \\nDalfampridine. The phenomenon might indicate that \\ndespite demyelination, patients might have sufficient \\nviable axons to overcome conduction block with \\nmedication. The sign can be quantitated using a t orque \\nmeasurement device developed at the Mayo Clinic for \\nthe study. It allows for both isometric and isoinertial \\ntesting. \\n \\nThe McArdle\\'s sign is moderately sensitive for a \\ndiagnosis of  MS when compared with other \\nmyelopathy conditions that mimic MS. The s ign can be \\nimmediately translated into practice. Finger extensor \\nmuscles, which are among the first muscles to weaken \\nin people with MS provide a convenient means of \\ntesting. Patients with symptoms of MS might have a \\ncompletely normal clinical exam, with n ormal reflexes \\nand strength, but lost strength with neck flexion.  \\n \\nA new antibody test for MS \\nInstead of the current CSF gold standard testing \\n(oligoclonal bands), the new antibody test measures \\nimmunoglobulin kappa (Igκ) free light chains.

Occupational therapy can help \\npeople learn how to walk using an assistive device or \\nin a way that saves physical energy. \\n \\nNote: Can the dietary supplement Acetyl -L-\\ncarnitine relieve MS fatigue? (1) \\n \\nAcetyl-L-carnitine is a form of L -carnitine, an amino \\nacid that is found in nearly all cells of the body. L -\\ncarnitine plays a critical role in the production of \\nenergy from long-chain fatty acids (LCFA). In addition, \\nit increases the activity of certain nerve  cells in the \\nCNS. Some studies have suggested that supplements \\ncould ease MS-related fatigue in people with low blood \\nlevels of L -carnitine. A small study found that Acetyl -\\nL-carnitine works better than certain medications, such \\nas Amantadine, used to tre at fatigue. But, additional \\nstudies have had inconclusive results, showing a \\npossible, but not statistically significant, benefit of this \\nsupplement. Currently, there is not enough evidence to \\nsupport the claim and more studies are needed. \\nAlthough Acetyl-L-carnitine generally has few or mild \\nside effects, it can interfere with blood -thinning \\nmedications and other drugs. \\n \\n10. Itching (1) \\n\\uf0b7 Vistaril (Hydroxyzine®). \\n11. Muscle weakness and spasticity (2) \\n \\nMuscle weakness and spasticity is common in MS. It \\nmay a ffect one or both legs, may be transient (lasting \\ndays or weeks), or progressive over many years as a \\nmajor symptom. For those MSers age forty or over, leg \\nweakness and spasticity may be the only symptoms, \\nprogressing slowly without any acute attacks. The \\nweakness pattern can be asymmetrical, involving one \\nlimb or one side more than the other, or it can seem to \\nbe only in the legs. \\n \\nMild spasticity can be managed by stretching and \\nexercising muscles using water therapy, yoga, or \\nphysical therapy. It is very  important that people with \\nMS stay physically active because physical inactivity \\ncan contribute to worsening stiffness, weakness, pain, \\nfatigue, and other symptoms. Various aids ankle brace \\nfor foot drop, cane) may also be necessary. During an \\nacute attack, weakness can be treated with intravenous \\nsteroids.

Spasticity can be reduced by exercise \\nand normal muscle use to prevent contractures. \\nSymptoms produced include: spasms, cramps, pain, \\naching. Helpful drugs are: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Baclofen (Liorisol®): Not tolerated by \\neveryone. Helpful in  reducing spasms and \\npain sometimes associated with spasticity and \\nimproving function.    \\n\\uf0b7 Botox (Onabotulinumtoxin ®). \\n\\uf0b7 Dalfampridine (Ampyra®): A potassium \\nchannel blocker to improve walking speed. \\n(See also category # 18) \\n\\uf0b7 Dantrium (Dantrolene®). \\n\\uf0b7 Klonopin (Clonazepam®). \\n\\uf0b7 Tizanidine (Zanaflex®): Especially effective \\nfor night spasms.

Stress \\n \\nStress management programs, relaxation training, \\nmembership in an MS support group, or individual \\npsychotherapy may help some people. \\n \\n17. Tremors (4) \\n \\nTremors (or uncontrollable shaking) develop in some \\npeople with MS. Assistive devices and weights \\nattached to utensils or even limbs are sometimes \\nhelpful for people with tremors. Deep brain stimulation \\nand drugs, such as Clonazepam, also may be useful. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Klonopin (Clonazepam®). \\n\\uf0b7 Laniazid - Nydrazid (Isoniazid®). \\n\\uf0b7 Onabotulinum toxin-A. \\n\\uf0b7 Propanolol (Inderal®): A beta-blocker. \\n \\n18. Walking, balance, gait, and ataxia (1) \\n \\nProblems with walking and balance occur in many \\npeople with MS because they can be caused by \\nchanges in different parts of the nervous system. The \\nmost common walking problem is ataxia —unsteady, \\nuncoordinated movements—due to damage to the areas \\nof the brain that coordinate muscle balance. People \\nwith severe ataxia generally benefit from the use of a \\ncane, walker, or other assistive device. Physical \\ntherapy also can reduce walking problems. In 2010, the \\n(U.S.) FDA has approved the following drug to  \\nimprove walking speed in people with MS (see also \\ncategory # 15): \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Ampyra (Dalfampridine®). \\n \\n \\n \\nThe following key points should be noted: \\n \\n• One lesser known effect of some commonly \\nprescribed antidepressants is that they can exacerbate \\nmuscle spasticity and further impede walking. \\n \\n• Even though managing MS symptoms may \\novershadow a person's medical concerns, regular \\npreventive health care remains important. Women with \\nMS should still get regular Pap tests and mammograms, \\nand women and men should have colonoscopies. \\n \\n• Any new aches and pains should be addressed \\nas they would be for anyone. \\n \\n• A physical medicine and rehabilitation \\nspecialist can help a patient address and correct \\nmusculoskeletal issues, which may alleviate pain. \"),\n",

It involves: \\n \\nComprehensive care \\nA complex disease such as MS requires a \\ncomprehensive approach. Not being currently a curable \\ndisease, effective strategies can help modify or slow \\nthe disease course, treat relapses, manage symptoms, \\nimprove function and safety, and address emotional \\nhealth. \\n \\nThe model of comprehensive MS care involves the \\nexpertise of many different healthcare professionals, \\neach contributing in a unique way to the m anagement \\nof the disease and the symptoms it can cause. \\nSometimes, this team works within a single center but, \\nmore often, a referral by the MS physician is made to \\nother specialists in the community. In either case, the \\ngoal is comprehensive and  coordina ted care to manage \\nthe disease and promote comfort, function, \\nindependence, health and wellness. \\n \\nFor most people with MS, being a specialist in diseases \\nof the nervous system, a neurologist functions as the \\nleader of the team, makes diagnosis, identifies \\ntreatment strategies, and coordinates these treatment \\nefforts with other members of the team. \\n \\nMS is only part of overall health \\n \\nComprehensive MS care is part — but not all — of the \\noverall health management strategies. Like the general \\npopulation, any in dividual is subject to medical \\nproblems that have nothing to do with one's MS. \\nRegular visits with a primary care physician, age -\\nappropriate screening tests, routine dental care, and \\ntaking care of dental issues are important and can help \\nprevent complicat ions from infections.  The parts that \\nmake up the whole include: \\n \\n• Modifying the disease course : Several FDA -\\napproved disease modifying drugs/therapies (DMD/Ts) \\nto treat symptoms, CIS, relapsing, secondary \\nprogressive MS, and other forms of the disease have \\nbeen discussed at length in this series of articles. These \\nmedications reduce the frequency a nd severity of \\nrelapses, reduce the accumulation of lesions in the \\nbrain and spinal cord, and may slow the accumulation \\nof disability for many.  \\n \\n• Treating exacerbations: An exacerbation of MS is \\ncaused by inflammation in the central nervous system \\n(CNS) that causes damage to the myelin and slows or \\nblocks the transmission of nerve impulses. To be a true \\nexacerbation, the attack must last at least 24 hours and \\nbe separated from a previous exacerbation by at least \\n30 days. However, most exacerbations last f rom a few \\ndays to several weeks or even months. Exacerbations \\ncan be mild or severe enough to interfere with a \\nperson’s ability to function at home and at work. \\nSevere exacerbations are most commonly treated with \\nhigh-dose corticosteroids to reduce the inflammation. \\n \\n• Promoting function through rehabilitation:  \\nRehabilitation programs focus on function. They are \\ndesigned to help improve or maintain the ability to \\nperform effectively and safely at home and at work. \\nRehabilitation professionals focus on overa ll fitness \\nand energy management while addressing problems \\nwith accessibility and mobility, speech and swallowing, \\nand memory and other cognitive functions. \\nRehabilitation is an important component of \\ncomprehensive quality healthcare for people with MS \\nat all stages of the disease. \\n \\n• Providing emotional support:  Comprehensive care \\nincludes attention to emotional health as well as \\nphysical health.

It helps \\nkeep different parts of the body work well, deal better \\nwith fatigue, move more easily, alleviate bowel and \\nbladder problems, sleep better, and manage side effects \\nfrom medication. \\n \\nManaging acute attacks \\n \\nAn acute attack (or relapse) means that new patches of \\ninflammation and demyelination are occurring in either \\nnew or old spots in the CNS (brain, spinal cord, optic \\nnerves). During severe symptomatic attacks, \\nadministration of high doses of intravenous \\ncorticosteroids, such a s Methylprednisolone, is the \\nusual therapy. Oral corticosteroids seem to have a \\nsimilar efficacy and safety profile. Although effective \\nin the short term for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid \\ntreatments do not appear to have a significant impact \\non long-term recovery. The long-term benefit is unclear \\nin optic neuritis. The consequences of severe attacks \\nthat do not respond to corticosteroids might be \\ntreatable by plasmapheresis. \\n \\nManaging relapses and pseudo-relapses \\n \\nTreatments include disease modifying d rugs/therapies \\n(DMD/Ts) for fewer and less serious relapses. DMD/Ts \\ncan reduce the number of relapses and slow down the \\nrate at which disability happens. They work better the \\nearlier one starts taking them. \\n \\nDamage caused by MS builds up over time, so the \\nsooner one begins treatment, the less damage will have \\nbuilt up before treatment starts to take effect. Some \\nmilder relapses will not need any special treatment \\nbeyond DMD/Ts. For more serious relapses, a short \\ncourse of steroids may be helpful. Like any d rug, \\nthough, steroids can have side effects. Also, whether a \\nrelapse is treated or not does not make any difference \\nto how much permanent disability it could cause. \\nRehabilitation after a relapse can help, including \\nphysiotherapy, occupational therapy, die tary advice, \\nsupport at work, and help in the home. \\n \\nManaging co-morbidities \\n \\nMany people living with MS also live with conditions \\n(co-morbidities) like diabetes, hypertension (high \\nblood pressure), heart disease, lung disease, and certain \\nmood disorders. Some people also live with other \\nautoimmune conditions. These co -morbid conditions \\ncan negatively impact MS by delaying diagnosis, \\ndelaying treatment, increasing the number of \\nhospitalizations, speeding -up disease progression, and \\nreducing quality of life.  Treating these additional \\nmedical or psychiatric conditions is essential not only \\nto overall health and well -being but also to the \\neffective management of MS as well. One should not \\nassume that everything is related to MS, should ensure \\nthat health care p roviders are communicating, and \\nshould keep an updated list of all medications and \\nsupplements taken. \\n \\n \\n \\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is typically diagnosed based on \\nthe presenting signs and symptoms in combination \\nwith supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing. \\nThe diagnosis is complex and difficult to arrive at \\nbecause it can cause many different symptoms.

They work the bett er \\nthe sooner they are started, but taking them later can \\nstill have benefits. These drugs/therapies can have side \\neffects, some serious, but not being treated entails the \\nrisk of more relapses and more long -term disability. \\nThere are 34 available such dru gs, all reviewed here, \\nwhich are taken either as a pill, an injection, or an \\ninfusion. Recent developments and emerging \\npharmacotherapies are also discussed as well as non -\\npharmacological therapies whose interventions for \\nchronic pain is insufficient to re commend them alone \\nincluding rehabilitation in its various forms (physical, \\ncognitive, occupational, speech language, vocational, \\nand palliative). Research on the immunobiology of MS \\nhas resulted in a variety of potent anti -inflammatory \\ntherapies but they are of extremely limited efficacy in \\nthe more important and disabling progressive phase, \\nwhich has emerged as the greatest clinical and research \\nchallenge. The application of autologous human stem \\ncell therapy is also abundantly discussed in terms of its \\nbenefits and effectiveness in the relapsing form of the \\ndisease. The prognosis of MS depends on the subtype \\nand progression of the disease. The guidelines usually \\nfollowed to infer prognosis are lastly summarized. \\n \\n \\n \\nACTH: Adrenocorticotropic hormone; AD: Alzheimer's \\ndisease; ALS: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; AML: \\nAcute myeloid leukemia; aSCT: autologous stem cell \\ntherapy; BTKI: Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor; \\nCAMT: Complementary and alternative medicine \\ntherapies; CIS: Clinically -isolated syndrome; CNS: \\nCentral nervous system; CRT: Cognitive rehabilitation \\ntherapy; DMD/T: Disease -modifying drugs/therapies; \\nEBMTR: European Bone Marrow Transplant Registry; \\nEBV: Epstein -Barr virus; EDSS: Expanded Disability \\nStatus S cale; ELISA: Enzyme -linked immunosorbent \\nassay; EPC: Endothelial progenitor cells; FACT: \\nFoundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy; \\nFDA: (U.S.) Food & Drug Administration; GD: Graves' \\ndisease; GI: Gastrointestinal; HDC: High dose \\nCASE STUDY                                                                                                                                                                 Open Access \\n \"),\n",

In 1900, the life expectancy of a person with \\nMS was only five years. Today, individuals can now \\nlive a normal life-span, though often with a struggle and \\nincreasing limitations. It was not until after World War \\nII that an immunologic cause of MS was seriously \\ninvestigated. Further, it was not until 1970 that the first \\npositive results of treatmen t with an immunologic \\ntherapy (steroids) were released. Beginning in the 1990s, \\nthe availability of treatments that modify the course of \\nMS, known as disease -modifying drugs/therapies \\n(DMD/Ts), has improved prognosis. These treatments \\ncan reduce relapses and slow progression but as of early \\n2023, there still is no cure. We also have learned a lot \\nabout the role of the immune system in how MS \\ndevelops and progresses, which has helped in the \\ndevelopment of  numerous DMD/Ts. Most of these \\ntherapies directly mod ulate the immune system to \\nprevent it from attacking the central nervous system \\n(CNS). Having multiple treatment options allows \\npeople living with MS to personalize their treatment. In \\nthis article, I will discuss at length all currently \\navailable DMD/Ts f or the several MS types including \\ntheir prescription guidelines, benefits, adverse effects, \\nand associated recent developments and em erging \\npharmacotherapies. I will  further present non -\\npharmacological therapies, immunotherapies, and \\nautologous stem cell t herapies and lastly elaborate on \\nthe prognosis and future outlook for the disease. \\n \\n \\n \\nAs seen in part II in this series, the symptoms and \\nprogression of demyelinating diseases vary between \\npatients. There are many treatments, including drugs, \\ndevices, and therapies that can help with symptoms \\nfrom muscle pain, stiffness, spasms, and poor balance to \\nincontinence issues, difficulties with speech, \\nswallowing, sight, memory and thinking, and sexual \\nfunction. Early diagn osis and discussion of treatment \\noptions is important. Irrespectively, emphasis is on \\nearly treatment. As illustrated in Figure 1 b elow, the \\nprogression of MS will increase significantly if left \\nuntreated or treatment is delayed. Beginning treatment \\nearly shows lower amounts of progression, which \\nsupports beginning treatment at the time of diagnosis.  \\n \\nDMD/Ts are used to treat MS when there are relapses or \\ninflammation seen on MRI scans. They could change \\n(for the better) how MS deve lops over time and could \\noffer many people the chance to take more control of \\ntheir MS. However, despite their benefits, they cannot \\nundo any permanent disability. They are not a cure, but \\nthey can reduce how many relapses occur and how \"),\n",

The aim is to \\nachieve a state where there is no evidence of disease \\nactivity (NEDA), meaning no relapses, no progression \\nof disability, and no evidence of activity on the MRI or \\nat least minimal evidence of disease activity (MEDA). \\nA variety of drug therapies are recommended depending \\non the specific disorder.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSymptoms \\nStrategies to treat symptoms (see Article II in this series \\nfor a fuller treatment) include medications to improve \\nwalking, spasms, bladder dysfunction, and other \\nsymptoms.

However, several \\ntreatment options with better safety and tolerability \\nprofiles have been introduced, changing the prognosis \\nof MS. \\n \\nAs with any medical treatment, medications used in the \\nmanagement of MS symptoms have several adverse \\neffects.  In the treatment era, 16% of people with \\nrelapsing MS went on to need a cane to walk after 20 \\nyears.  \\n \\nAttacks \\nAgainst attacks, the following tw o treatments are \\nemployed: \\n \\n• Corticosteroids: Corticosteroids, such as intravenous \\nMethylprednisolone, are prescribed over the course of \\n3 to 5 days. Intravenous steroids quickly and potently \\nsuppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. \\nThey may be  followed by a tapered dose of oral \\nCorticosteroids. Clinical trials have shown that these \\ndrugs hasten recovery from MS attacks, but do not alter \\nthe long-term outcome of the disease. \\n \\n• Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis):   It can treat \\nsevere flare-ups in people with relapsing forms of MS \\nwho do not have a good response to \\nMethylprednisolone. Plasma exchange involves taking \\nblood out of the body and removing components in the \\nblood’s plasma that are thought to be harmful. The rest \\nof the blood, plus replace ment plasma, is then \\ntransfused back into the body. This treatment has not \\nbeen shown to be effective for secondary progressive \\nor chronic progressive MS. \\n \\nRelapsing remitting MS (RRMS) \\nAs of 2021, multiple DMD/Ts have been approved by \\nregulatory agencies for RRMS. They are modestly \\neffective at decreasing the number of attacks. The first -\\nline treatments (Interferons and Glatiramer acetate) are \\nroughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately \\n30%. Early -initiated long -term therapy is safe and \\nimproves outcomes. \\n \\nTreatment of a clinically -isolated syndrome (CIS) with \\nInterferons decreases the chance of progressing to \\nclinical MS. Efficacy of Interferons and Glatiramer \\nacetate in children has been estimated to be roughly \\nequivalent to that of adults. The  role of som e newer \\nagents such as Fingolimod, Teriflunomide, and \\nDimethyl fumarate is not yet entirely clear. It is \\ndifficult to make firm conclusions about the best \\ntreatment, especially regarding the long ‐term benefit \\nand safety of early treatment, give n the lack o f studies \\ndirectly comparing DMD/Ts or long -term monitoring \\nof patient outcomes. \\n \\nThe relative effectiveness of different treatments is \\nunclear, as most have only been compared to placebo \\nor a small number of other therapies. Direct \\ncomparisons of Interferons and Glatiramer acetate \\nindicate similar effects or only small differences in \\neffects on relapse rate, disease progression, and MRI \\nmeasures. Alemtuzumab, Natalizumab, and \\nFingolimod may be more effective than other drugs in \\nreducing relapse s over the short term in people with \\nRRMS. Natalizumab and Interferon beta -1a (Rebid) \\nmay reduce relapses compared to both placebo and \\nInterferon beta -1a (Avonex) while Interferon beta -1b \\n(Betaseron), Glatiramer acetate, and Mitoxantrone may \\nalso prevent r elapses. Evidence on relative \\neffectiveness in reducing disability progression is \\nunclear. All medications are associated with adverse \\neffects that may influence their risk-to-benefit profiles. \\n \\nSecondary Progressive MS (SPMS) \\nAs of 2011, only one medicati on, Mitoxantrone, had \\nbeen approved for SPMS. In this population, tentative \\nevidence supports this drug moderately, slowing the \\nprogression of the disease, and decreasing rates of \\nrelapses over two years. \\n '),\n",

Fymat, J Neurol Psychol Res (2023), 4:1  \\nP a g e  | 5 \\n \\n \\nJ Neurol Psychol Res, an open access Journal  Volume 4 • Issue 1 • 2023 \\nAs of 2013, review of 9 modulators and \\nimmunosuppressants found no evidence of any being \\neffective in preventing disability progression in people \\nwith progressive MS. In 2019, Siponimod and \\nCladribine were approved in the U.S. for the treatment \\nof SPMS. \\n \\nPrimary progressive MS (PPMS) \\nIn March 2017, the (U.S.) FDA approved ocrelizumab \\nas a treatment for PPMS in adults, the first drug to gain \\nthat approval, with requirements for several Phase IV \\nclinical trials. It is also used for the treatment of \\nrelapsing forms of MS, to include clinically -isolated \\nsyndrome, relapsing -remitting disease, and active \\nsecondary progressive disease in adults. \\n \\nCategorization of DMD/Ts  \\nWhile there is no cure for MS, treatments can help \\nspeed recovery from attacks, reduce the number and \\nseriousness of relapses, reduc e the damage caused by \\nrelapses, modify the course of the disease, and manage \\nsymptoms. New treatments can reduce long -term \\ndisability for many people with MS. Currently, there is \\nno clear way to prevent the disease from developing. \\nDMD/Ts are not a cure, but they could make a big \\ndifference to MS. They offer many people with MS the \\nchance to take more control of it and their lives. \\n \\nCurrent therapies approved by the (U.S.) FDA for MS \\nare designed to modulate or suppress the inflammatory \\nreactions of the di sease. They only work with those \\ntypes of MS that have relapses. They are most effective \\nfor RRMS at early stages of the disease. Depending on \\ntheir mode of administration, DMD/Ts fall into three \\ncategories of medications (Table 1): \\n \\nInjectables (3) \\nInjectables are given by injection under the skin or in a \\nmuscle. They are: \\n \\n• Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone 20 mg and 40 mg \\ndoses, Flattop®):  They can reduce relapse rates and \\nhave long-term safety data. \\n \\n• Interferons: Interferons include Avonex®,Pleurisy®, \\nand Rebid® (interferons beta -1a); Betaseron® and \\nOctavia® (interferons beta -1b), These medicines \\n\"interfere\" with diseases that attack the body. They \\nwork by decreasing inflammation and increasing nerve \\ngrowth. There are many interferon drugs. There is \\nsome c ontroversy about how long interferons help in \\nthe treatment of MS. Octavia reduces relapses that \\ncause the progression of disability. Possible side effects \\nare reactions where the injection is given, flu -like \\nsymptoms, liver irritation, and anemia. The dos ing of \\ninterferons varies depending on which drug is used. \\n \\n• Unfathomably (Pikestaff®, Arranger):  This \\nmonoclonal antibody was approved by the FDA in \\n2020. It targets B-cells that damage the nervous system \\nand decreases brain lesions and worsening symptom s. \\nPossible side effects are infections, local reactions to \\nthe injection, and headaches. \\n \\nOral medicines (10) \\n• Baguio (Teriflunomide): It is a convenient once -a-\\nday pill that affects white blood cells to decrease \\ninflammation. \\n• Beautifier™ (Mono methyl fumarate). \\n• Cladribine (Maven clad):  FDA-approved since \\n2019, this drug treats RRMS and SPMS forms of MS. \\nIn clinical trials, Cladribine reduced the progression of \\ndisability and significantly reduced relapse rates. \\nHowever, becau se of safety risks, it is generally used \\nwhen people cannot take other drugs for MS or when \\nthose drugs are not effective. \\n• Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera):  It decreases \\ninflammation and helps protect cells. Possible side \\neffects are flushing, liver inflammation, and digestive \\ntract irritation. \\n• Proximal fumarate (Temerity). \\n• Fingolimod (Gilenya): It was the first -approved oral \\nmedicine for MS.

The most common treatment regimen is a \\nthree or five-day course of intravenous (Solu -Medrol® \\n- Methylprednisolone) or oral (Deltasone® - \\nPrednisone) corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are not \\nbelieved to have any long-term benefit on the disease. \\n \\nOther treatment options \\n \\nH.P. Acthar Gel is a highly -purified preparation of \\nadrenocorticotropic hormone  (ACTH) in a gel that is \\ndesigned to provide extended release of the ACTH \\nfollowing injection. It is FDA -approved for the \\ntreatment of MS relapses in adults. Its use is limited \\ndue to high cost and access issues. It is often \\nconsidered when someone cannot tolerate \\nglucocorticoids. \\n \\nPlasmapheresis (plasma exchange) may also be \\nconsidered for severe exacerbations that do not respond \\nadequately to the standard steroid treatment. \\n \\nRecent developments and emerging \\npharmacotherapies \\nProtective effect and lower risk of MS \\nResearch over the years has shown that maintaining \\nadequate levels of vitamin D may have a protective \\neffect and lower the risk of developing MS. Therefore, \\nvitamin D supplementation is considered an important \\nmodifiable environmental risk factor for development \\nof MS. It may also offer some benefits to people who \\nalready have sufficient vitamin D in their body. \\nBenefits include: lessening the frequency and severity \\nof symptoms, improving the quality of life, and \\nlengthening the time it takes to progress from RRMS to \\nthe SPMS phase. But the evidence is not conclusive. \\n \\nRelapsing-remitting MS \\n \\nThe majority of FDA -approved drugs since the early \\n1990s are effective at helping to manage RRMS, which \\naffects between 85% and 90% of people diagnosed \\nwith th is disease. Some people with RRMS can \\ntransition to SPMS after several years. Currently \\navailable DMD/Ts have little impact on this phase of \\nthe disease. Therefore, it is best to develop a treatment \\nregimen during the earlier relapsing -remitting phase, \\nincluding: \\n \\n• Corticosteroids: Relapses, attacks, or \\nexacerbations can be managed with corticosteroids \\nsuch as intravenous Methylprednisolone (Depo -Medrol, \\nMedrol). These medicines decrease inflammation and \\nhave been used to help reduce the symptoms of MS \\nrelapses. \\n• Plasmapheresis: In this procedure, the liquid \\npart of the blood (plasma) is separated from the blood \\ncells; the cells are then combined with a protein \\nsolution (albumin) and put back into the body. In this \\nfashion, the blood plasma is cleansed fro m circulating \\nproteins to help with recovery from MS relapses. \\nPossible side effects are dizziness, nausea, and a \\ndecrease in blood pressure. \\n• Bruton\\'s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKI):  \\nThis emerging therapy is being studied in relapsing -\\nremitting and sec ondary-progressive MS. It works by \\npredominantly modulating B - cells and microglia (the \\nimmune cells in the central nervous system). \\n• Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation \\n(HSCT): In this therapy, the immune system is \\nsuppressed and replacement transpla nted healthy stem \\ncells (SCs) are inserted.

The goal of rehabilitation is to \\nimprove and maintain function, an essential component \\nof comprehensive MS care.

Studies investigating \\ninformation provision in support of patient \\nunderstanding and participation suggest that while \\ninterventions (written information, decision aids, \\ncoaching, educational programs) may increase \\nknowledge, the evidence of an effect on decision -\\nmaking and quality of life is mixed and of low certainty. \\nThere is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of  \\nindividual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good \\nevidence that specific approaches, such as exercise and \\npsychological therapies, are effective. \\n \\nCognitive Rehabilitation Therapy (CRT) \\nCognitive training, alone or combined with other \\nneuropsychological interventions, may show positive \\neffects for memory and attention though firm \\nconclusions are not possible given small sample \\nnumbers, variable methodology, interventions, and \\noutcome measures.

There is a \\nvigorous debate in the field as to whether primary \\nautoimmunity or degeneration lies at the foundation. \\nUnravelling this controversy will be critically \\nimportant for developing effective new therap ies for \\nthe most disabling later phases of this disease. \\n \\nBrain Immunotherapy \\n \\nIn parallel with immunotherapy as an emergent therapy \\nfor cancer, I advanced earlier the opinion that brain \\nimmunotherapy should also become a similar therapy \\nfor brain cancers and neurological disorders (Fymat, \\n2017a-h; 2018a -f; 2019a -e; 2020a -f; 2021a -c; 2022; \\n2023), providing a paradigm shift in our therapeutic \\napproach to brain cancer and these disorders. \\n \\nThe approach advocated there and here would be to \\nregulate the underlying autoimmune system (not to \\neither enhance it immeasurably or suppress it totally), \\nto boost in a measured manner the synaptoclastic \\nsignals while at the same time taming down the \\nsynaptoblastic ones. This idea builds upon work done \\non diabetes ty pe I, an incurable disease so far. There, \\nthe autoimmune system is taught to tolerate the insulin -\\nproducing cells of the pancreas so that it does not \\ndestroy the diabetic patient's ability to produce the \\nglucose-regulating insulin. The similar idea forms t he \\nbasis of various clinical trials for treating other \\nincurable diseases such as MS and Graves' disease \\n(GD). Again, the overarching purpose is to harness the \\nhyperactive autoimmune system. This can be \\naccomplished in two manners by employing: \\n \\n• Naturally existing molecules:  These can induce an \\nimmune response (antigens); or \\n• Engineered immune cells:  These can train the \\nautoimmune system to tolerate the process or tissue it \\nis on track to damage. \\n \\nThe above idea has the potential to cure a range of \\nautoimmune disorders, including especially \\nneurological and neurodegenerative disorders, \\nparticularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) but perhaps also \\nMS. This requires a deep understanding of the \\nmolecular basis of autoimmunity, including brain and \\ncentral nervous sy stem (CNS) immunity, as well as \\nadvances in genetic engineering and cell-based therapy. \\nCaution must nonetheless be exercised as deploying \\nthe immune system to treat certain diseases can also \\npotentially trigger other autoimmune diseases, e.g., in \\nthe case  of cancer, it may additionally trigger \\nrheumatoid arthritis and colitis. \\n \\nThe main immune players are the regulatory T -cells \\n(Treg), which act as the brakes of the immune system. \\nSimilarly to other T -cells, Treg -cells rein in the \\nimmune cells that are doi ng damage. It has been \\nsuggested that the body can be made to produce the \\nTreg-cells required to dampen a certain autoimmune \\nresponse by dosing people who are affected with the \\nsame antigen or antigens that the immune system \\nwrongly interprets as a reason to attack.

The approach is similar to vaccination \\nwithout the immune -system stimulants called \\n'adjuvants' that are usually include d in vaccine \\nformulations. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSCT is the use of stem cells (SC) to treat or prevent a \\ndisease or condition. One of the oldest form of it is \\nbone marrow transplantation that has been used for \\nmany years without controversy. Mesenchymal stem \\ncells (MSCs) are injected via a lumbar puncture with \\nthe hope that they will mature into nerve cells. The \\nadvantages and disadvantages of this other form of \\ntherapy, and its potential application for the treatment \\nof neurodegenerative dise ases/disorders (NDDs), \\nincluding MS, are appreciable. Of particular interest to \\nus are regenerative treatments, and the treatment of \\nneurodegenerative conditions. \\n \\nRegenerative treatment \\n \\nIn regenerative treatment, SCs mediate repair via five \\nprimary mechanisms: \\n \\n• Providing an anti-inflammatory effect.  \\n• Homing-in onto damaged tissues and recruiting \\nother cells: Usually, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) \\nthat are necessary for tissue growth.  \\n• Supporting tissue remodeling over scar formation.  \\n• Inhibiting apoptosis (or cell death).  \\n• Differentiating into bone, cartilage, tendon, and \\nligament tissue. \\n \\nTo further enrich blood supply to the damaged areas \\nand, consequently, promote tissue regeneration, \\nplatelet-rich plasma could additionally be used in \\nconjunction with the therapy. The efficacy of some SC \\npopulations may be affected by the method of delivery. \\n \\nThe advantages of SC therapy include: \\n \\n• Lessening the symptoms or conditions of the \\ndisease treated.  \\n• Allowing patients to reduce their drug intake. \\n \\nSafety studies are under way in the case of certain \\nuntreatable neurological diseases, including \\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple \\nsystem atrophy (MSA). It is not yet known if these \\ntreatments will provide benefit for patients and whether \\nthese are broadly applicable in neurological diseases. \\n \\nNeurodegeneration \\n \\nIn the case of neurodegeneration and NDDs, it is \\nknown that healthy adult brains contain neural stem \\ncells (NSCs), which divide to maintain general stem \\ncell numbers or beco me progenitor cells. In healthy \\nlaboratory animals, progenitor cells migrate within the \\nbrain and function primarily to maintain neuron \\npopulations for olfaction (the sense of smell). In these \\nanimals, research has been conducted on the effects of \\nSCs on b rain degeneration including such brain \\ndiseases as AD, Parkinson's disease (PD), ALS, and \\nMS. Of particular note, pharmacological activation of \\nendogenous neural SCs has been reported to induce \\nneuroprotection and behavioral recovery in adult rat \\nmodels of neurological disorder. \\n \\nIn the case of N DDs, including especially AD and \\ndementia, SCs have been shown to have a low \\nimmunogenicity (the promotion of immune properties) \\ndue to the relatively low number of major \\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules found \\non their surface. They have also been found to secrete \\nchemokines that alter the immune response and \\npromote tolerance of the new tissue. Notwithstanding \\nthis low immunogenicity of SCs, I would still advocate \\nSC therapy for the treatment of AD and de mentia only \\nunder the following conditions: A prior radiation \\ntreatment is not required so as not to suppress the \\nimmune system, minimizing the secretion of \"),\n",

Pluripotency in certain SCs \\ncould make it difficult to obtain a specific cell ty pe; not \\nall cells in a population differentiate uniformly, making \\nit difficult to obtain the exact cell type needed. \\nUndifferentiated cells can create tissues other than the \\ndesired types. Pluripotent stem cells (PSC) can form \\ntumors, which is particularly  the case for embryonic, \\nfetal, and induced PSCs. \\n \\nOther autoimmune diseases of the nervous system \\n \\nAs with MS, using the patient's own stem cells might \\nstop disease progression in the case of other \\nautoimmune diseases of the nervous system. In such \\ncases, aggressive immunotherapies are available that \\ncould mitigate the need for autologous stem cell \\ntransplants. \\n \\nAutologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation \\n(aHSCT) \\naHSCT is an intense chemotherapy treatment for MS. \\nIt aims to stop the damage MS causes  by wiping out \\nand then regrowing the immune system, using the \\npatient's own stem cells (so-called 'autologous' SCs). \\n \\nWho can benefit from aHSCT? \\n \\nResearch has shown that aHSCT may be a safe and \\neffective treatment for people with MS who: \\n \\n• Have highly a ctive relapsing MS and still have \\nrelapses despite taking DMD/Ts.  \\n• Have progressive MS and still have active \\ninflammation (either relapses or lesions shown on MRI \\nscans). \\n• Are at an early course of their disease.  \\n• Do not have significant disability (a s measured by the \\nExpanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).  \\n• Are less than 50 years of age. \\n• Have had MS for less than 10 years. \\n• Have breakthrough disease activity  (new \\ninflammatory lesions on MRI and/or relapses) despite \\ntreatment with a high -efficacy DMD/T* or are unable \\nto take a high-efficacy DMD/T. \\n \\n[*Note: High-efficacy DMD/Ts include: Alemtuzumab \\n(Lemtrada®), Natalizumab (Tysabri®), Ocrelizumab \\n(Ocrevus®), Ofatumumab (Kesimpta®).  And \\nRituximab (Rituxan®), Some MS specialists consider \\nCladribine (Mavenclad®) in this group.] \\n \\nFactors including older age, greater disability and \\ncertain health conditions (for example, heart or lung \\ndisease) are associated with increased risk of life -\\nthreatening side effects. aHSCT is unlikely to help in \\nadvanced progr essive MS and no longer having \\nrelapses or signs of inflammation on MRI.

Research is \\nunderway to determine whether less intensive \\nimmunosuppressive protocols produce effective results \\nand fewer side effects. \\n \\nThe steps involved are: \\n \\n• Review by a specialist team. \\n• Readying of stem cells for collection. \\n• Mobilization of stem cells: Treatment begins with \\ndrugs to encourage stem cells to move out of the bone \\nmarrow and into the blood and be collected. Drugs \\ninclude: a chemotherapy infusion to wipe out the \\nimmune system (can take several days) and G -CSF \\ninjections. The chemotherapy may be 'myeloablative' \\n(completely wipes out the immune system) or 'non -\\nmyeloablative' (partially wipes out the immune system). \\nThe side effects of chemotherapy include nausea and \\nvomiting that can be controlled with drugs. \\n \\nThe symptoms of MS can get temporarily worse during \\nthis stage. \\n \\n• Collection of stem cells: Around 10 days later, when \\nthere are enough stem cells in the blood, they will be \\nremoved and stored for later in the procedure. \\n• Back-transplant of stem cells into the blood by a drip \\nto help regrow the immune system:  This usually takes \\nplace a couple of days after the chemotherapy, once the \\ndrugs have cleared the system. \\n• Refunctioning of the stem cells: Stem cells get to \\nwork making new blood and immune cells within 10 to \\n30 days of the transplant. As the immune system is not \\nworking yet, infections are likely during this period, \\nrequiring assistive antibiotics and transfusions.  \\n• Recovery from aHSCT: Anyone having aHSCT has to \\nspend around a mon th in an isolation room while the \\nimmune system rebuilds itself. Typically, recovery \\ntakes 3-6 months but, for some, it can take more than a \\nyear to fully recover. \\nAfter the aHSCT treatment \\n \\nFollow-up appointments are critical after treatment and \\ninclude: \\n \\n• Medical, neurological, and cognitive evaluations. \\n• MRIs and blood tests. \\n• Support for mental health and wellbeing. \\n \\nThe transplant unit should organize regular outpatient \\nmonitoring in the first 2 years following the procedure \\nand afterwards, if neede d. MRIs need to be performed \\nwithin 6 months of aHSCT and at least annually \\nthereafter. Recommendations are: \\n \\n• Patients should be able to self -refer into a \\nhematology department or another department that is \\nfamiliar with aHSCT, any time, 7 days a week, 2 4 \\nhours a day. \\n• Patients should isolate themselves, wear a \\nmask, and socially distance for a period of time \\nfollowing the procedure to reduce the risk of infections \\n(including COVID-19). \\n• Long-term monitoring should be backed up by \\npatient data being hel d by a bone marrow transplant \\nregistry such as, for example, the European Bone \\nMarrow Transplant Registry (EBMTR). \\n• The risks of infection persist for long periods \\nafter aHSCT so antibiotics are recommended for many \\nmonths, or sometimes even life-long. \\n \\nThe outcomes of the treatment and information learned \\nfrom the follow -up appointments will further inform \\nhow aHSCT works in MS. \\n \\nFinding an aHSCT treatment center \\n \\nIt is crucial that aHSCT be performed at an accredited \\ntreatment location.

It is \\nrandomly assigning eligible participants to undergo \\naHSCT or receive certain DMD/Ts to compare the \\ncosts, safety, and effectiveness of the two treatments. \\n \\nIn Italy, researchers at the Scientific Inst itute in Milan \\nrecently reported (January 2023) the results of an \\naHSCT clinical trial during which they experimented \\nwith neural SCs collected from the brain of an aborted \\nfetus. These cells were grown into nervous system cells \\nafter having injected them in the spinal fluid of 12 \\npeople with a form of MS that worsened over time. \\nThe trial findings compared participants with \\n(unspecified) lower- and higher-dose of SCs.  \\n \\nThey were: (1) Three months after transplantation, the \\nhigher-dose participants had hig her levels of protecting \\nneurons and anti -inflammatory molecules in their \\nspinal fluid; (2) after 2 years, the higher -dose group \\nretained more brain grey matter; and (3) over the next \\ntwo years, none of the trial participants experienced \\nany adverse reaction. While small, a similar trial with a \\nlarger number of participants would be warranted. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nComplementary and alternative medicine therapies \\n(CAMT) are discussed at great length in my book \\n(Fymat, 2023), and will not be discussed here. They \\ninclude: Biologically -based therapies (dietary \\nsupplements; diets; bee -venom therapy); mind -body \\ntherapies (guided imagery; hypnosis; meditation); \\nalternative medical systems (traditional Chinese \\nmedicine; Ayu rvedic medicine; homeopathy); \\nmanipulative and body -based therapies (chiropractic; \\nreflexology massage); energy therapies (therapeutic \\ntouch; magnets); and other therapies. \\n \\n \\n \\nPrognosis means the likely course of a health condition, \\nbased on medical experience. It is very difficult to \\npredict the course of MS. The type, duration, severity, \\nand impact of symptoms will vary from individual to \\nindividual. Some people will go for lo ng periods with \\nfew or no symptoms whilst others will experience more \\nfrequent or persistent problems.  \\n \\nThere are some factors that have been shown to \\nsuggest how MS may develop. These have been \\nobserved in long -term studies and reflect a general \\ntrend. H owever, they do not represent a guide \\nregarding how a specific person's MS will develop as it \\nremains a very unpredictable condition. \\n \\nWhen it comes to the prognosis for MS, there is both \\ngood news and bad news. Although MS is not fatal, \\nthere is currently no cure — MS is a chronic condition. \\nBut, many people who have MS also have to contend \\nwith other issues that can decrease their quality of life.  \\n \\nEven though most will never become severely disabled, \\nmany experience symptoms that cause pain, discomfort,  \\nand inconvenience. \\n \"),\n",

There are some \\nguidelines that may be used to infer a prognosis. Thus, \\nfor example, for relapsing MS (RMS), which is the \\nmost common subtype, approximately one of every \\nfive people later transitions to secondary progressive \\nMS (SPMS), a form characterized by a more \\nprogressive decline. Approximately 85% of MS \\npatients begin w ith the relapsing -remitting form of the \\ndisease. As discussed earlier, MS relapses can involve \\na single neural system such as optic neuritis, or several \\nanatomically distinct systems at the same time like \\ncombined motor and sensory problems. Attacks \\ninvolving single neural systems are somewhat more \\ncommon in the first exacerbation of MS. \\n \\nIn a 2016 cohort study, it was found that after a median \\nof 16.8 years from onset, one in ten of those with RMS \\nneeded a walking aid, and almost two in ten \\ntransitioned to SPMS. With treatments available in the \\n2020s, relapses can be eliminated or substantially \\nreduced. While most people with MS have a normal \\nlife expectancy, a few of them with very severe \\ndisability may die prematurely of infectious \\ncomplications such as p neumonia, giving an overall \\nlife expectancy of about 95% that of normal healthy \\nindividuals.  \\n \\nHowever, \"silent progression\" of the disease still \\noccurs. In addition to SPMS, a small proportion of \\npeople with MS (10% -15%) experience progressive \\ndecline fro m the onset, known as primary progressive \\nMS (PPMS). Whereas most treatments have been \\napproved for use in RMS; there are limited effective \\ntreatments for progressive forms of MS and they are \\nnot as effective. \\n \\nThe prognosis for PMS is worse, with faster \\naccumulation of disability, though the rate of decline \\nvaries considerably between people. In untreated \\nPPMS, the median time from onset to requiring a \\nwalking aid is estimated as seven years. In SPMS, a \\n2014 cohort study reported that people required a \\nwalking aid after an average of five years from its \\nonset and were chair - or bed-bound after fifteen years \\non the average. While the long -term outcome is \\ndifficult to predict, better outcomes are more often seen \\nin women, those who develop the disease early i n life, \\nthose with a relapsing course, and those who initially \\nexperienced few attacks. \\n \\nThe average longevity in the population of patients \\nwith MS is very difficult to estimate because it varies \\nwidely from patient to patient. An average life span of \\n25 to 35 years after the diagnosis of MS is made is \\noften stated. Some of the most common causes of death \\nin MS patients are secondary complications resulting \\nfrom immobility, chronic urinary tract infections, \\ncompromised swallowing and breathing, chronic bed  \\nsores, urogenital sepsis, and aspiration or bacterial \\npneumonia. \\n \\nClinical factors that influence prognosis \\n \\nLet us first summarize those clinical factors that \\ninfluence prognosis (Table 3). After a diagnosis of MS, \\ncharacteristics that predict a worse course are male sex, \\nolder age, and greater disability at the time of diagnosis. \\nFemale sex, though, is associated with a higher relapse \\nrate.  \\n \\nAs of 2018, no biomarker can accurately predict \\ndisease progression in every patient. Spinal cord \\nlesions, abnormalities on MRI, and more brain atrophy \\nare predictive of a worse course, though brain atrophy \\nas a predictor of disease course is experimental and not \\ngenerally used in clinical practice.  \\n \\nEarly treatment leads to a better prognosis, but a higher \\nrelapse frequency when treated with DMD/Ts is \\nassociated with a poorer prognosis.

Fymat, J Neurol Psychol Res (2023), 4:1  \\nP a g e  | 24 \\n \\n \\nJ Neurol Psychol Res, an open access Journal  Volume 4 • Issue 1 • 2023 \\n \\n \\n \\n• The first few years after disease onset is an \\nimportant time:  The number and type of relapses as \\nwell as how much of a recovery will help predict the \\nfuture disease course. Relapses that involve visual, \\nsensory or brainstem system s have a better prognosis \\nthan those that involve cerebellar, motor, or sphincter \\nsystems.  \\n• In the first 2 years of disease:  A low relapse rate \\nwith excellent recovery indicates a better prognosis \\nthan a high relapse rate with poor recovery. Relapses \\nthat are restricted to a single neural system are \\nprognostically better than those involving multiple \\nsystems. The relapse rate a lso has prognostic \\nsignificance in the later stages of MS.  \\n• With a disease duration of 5 or more years:  An \\nincreasing relapse rate, polyregional relapses that \\ninvolve multiple systems, and incomplete recovery \\nfrom relapses indicate a worse prognosis. Mos t people \\nexperience the severest disabilities of MS within 5 \\nyears of diagnosis. \\n• After 5 years:  Disabilities do not continue to worsen \\nsignificantly. Therefore, if no additional disabilities \\nappear within the first five years, then, they are \\nunlikely to occur in the future. But, nobody can predict \\nwhat will happen to any one person and so many things \\ncan have an influence on that. It has been proven over \\nthese short years that doing all of the \"right things\" will \\nincrease the odds of a better outcome. \\n• Fifteen 15 years after diagnosis:  It is estimated that \\nfor all MS patients the chance of walking unaided in 15 \\nyears following disease onset is 50%. Half of the \\npatients will need assistance in walking or will be \\nwheelchair bound; another half of the patien ts will be \\nable to ambulate unaided. \\n• After 25 years since diagnosis:  Approximately 10% \\nremain free of major ambulatory disability as measured \\nby the EDSS even without treatment. If an MS patient\\'s \\nEDSS score is 2 or lower for 10 years or longer, there \\nis a 90% chance that the disease will continue to \\nremain stable. This latter group constitutes 17% of MS \\npatients and can be designated as “benign” in an \\nambulatory sense. Here, benign MS does not designate \\na specific type of disease course, but describes on ly \\nmild disease severity after time. In addition, while most \\npatients have RRMS, some other patients may have a \\nvery slow progression but still remain benign. Within \\nthe benign RRMS patients, some have multiple \\nrelapses with almost complete recovery, and o thers \\nmay have a paucity of relapses or CNS inflammatory \\nactivity as evidenced by imaging studies. \\n• Around 33 years:  This is the average time before \\nhaving severe disability that causes patients to be \\nrestricted in bed.   \\n• Frequency of death by suicide:  It was found to be \\n7.5 times higher among patients with MS compared to \\nthe general population. It was also found that in \\nsuicidal patients, suicide rate did not correlate with \\ndisability. \\n \\nIt should be noted that once a moderate level of \\ndisability is reac hed, these early clinical predictors do \\nnot seem to influence the continued progression of \\nirreversible disability, suggesting that the long -term \\ncourse and disability may be established early in MS. \\nThe progressive phase in MS, regardless of the \\npresence (secondary-progressive) or absence (primary -\\nprogressive) of initial relapses, behaves similarly, and \\nrapid early progression of disability that includes three \\nor more systems is unfavorable in progressive MS. \\n \\nAdhering to a treatment plan of using a DMD/T is the \\nbest possible strategy for managing MS and giving a \\nfar better prognosis. Now, because taking a DMD/T \\nover a long period of time can be challenging, it is \\nimportant to understand its role in the overall MS \\ntreatment plan, and to be aware of the obst acles that \\ncan most often interfere with adherence to that plan. \\n '),\n",

While certain types of MS can potentially \\naffect lifespan, they are the exception — not the rule. \\nThe life expectancy of patients with MS is 7 to 14 \\nyears shorter than that of the general population, but \\nthis gap is diminishing as available treatments improve. \\nThe average life expectancy of a patient with MS is, on \\naverage, 35 years from diseas e onset. The chance that \\nthey will still be able to walk unaided 15 years after \\ndisease onset is 50%. \\n \\nPeople with MS must contend with many difficult \\nsymptoms that will affect their lifestyle. But, with \\nappropriate treatment of the disease, their life \\nexpectancy essentially mirrors that of people who do \\nnot have the condition. \\n \\nWays to improve the MS outlook \\n \\nDespite the challenges that come with MS, there are \\nways to improve the outlook and live a happy life. \\nHow a person thinks and feels about their condition \\nand their ability to manage, cope, and live with their \\nhealth challenges can affect outcomes. People with \\nhigh levels of self -esteem are more likely to feel they \\ncan influence their MS symptoms and are more likely \\nto make lifestyle and behavioral  changes for better \\nhealth, which can lead to improved symptoms. Some \\nways to improve the perspective on MS are: Build and \\nnurture relationships; manage stress; monitor one's \\nmood; practice solution -based problem solving; \\nrecognize family needs; and stay centered. \\n \\nTreatments that can prolong life expectancy \\n \\nDMD/Ts can have a positive impact on MS prognosis. \\nResearch has shown that patients who took Interferon -\\nbeta medications for 3 years or more had a lower risk \\nof death than patients who had not taken th em. This \\nbenefit in life expectancy was maintained even for \\npatients who started treatment more than 5 years after \\ndisease onset or after they were age 40. The potential \\nbeneficial effects of other, newer DMD/Ts on \\nprognosis remain to be investigated as th ey become \\nmore widely used by the MS patient community. \\n \\nCarefully monitoring other health conditions not \\nrelated to MS (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, \\nhypercholesterolemia, and hyperglycemia, as well as \\nthe mental health of patients) is also important in \\nprolonging life expectancy. \\n \\nFinally, physical activity plays an important role in \\nsupporting the health of patients with MS and may \\nprolong life expectancy. The (U.S.) National Multiple \\nSclerosis Society (NMSS) published exercise and \\nphysical activity recommendations for all people with \\nMS regardless of the level of disability. According to \\nthe guidelines, patients with MS should engage in at \\nleast 150 minutes per week of aerobic and breathing \\nexercise and/or lifestyle physical activity. Depen ding \\non the patient’s abilities, lifestyle physical activities \\nmay include active gaming, active weight shifting, \\nseated dancing, yoga, and boxing. \\n \\nEffect on quality of life \\n \\nLiving with MS can impact the quality of life. This \\ncondition affects everyone d ifferently, but there are \\nsome similarities among people with MS. For example, \\nmany people with MS experience physical disabilities, \\nanxiety, depression, and fatigue that make it \\nchallenging to work or enjoy activities with family and \\nfriends. MS may affec t: Career or education; family \\nand social life; mental health; and physical health. \\n \\nMS symptoms can range from mild to severe and may \\ncome and go over time. Quality of life may fluctuate \\nwith symptoms. Physical disability and depression may \\nhave the greatest impact on quality of life, so it is vital \\nto seek treatment in these areas. \\n \"),\n",

These include respiratory infecti ons, urinary \\ntract infections, sepsis, and skin disease. Other \\nattributed causes are associated with advanced \\ndisability and immobility, and include aspiration \\npneumonia and chronic respiratory disease. \\n \\nResearch has shown that death by suicide is higher \\namong patients with MS than the rest of the population. \\nHowever, the rate of suicide does not correlate with the \\nseverity of the disability. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe symptoms and progression of demyelinating \\ndiseases vary between patients. There are many \\nsymptomatic treatments including drugs, devices, and \\ntherapies. Early diagnosis and discussion of treatment \\noptions is important with emphasis on early treatment. \\nDisease-modifying drugs/therapies (DMD/Ts) can \\nchange (for the better) how MS develops over t ime, \\noffering many people the chance to take more control \\nof their disease. However, despite their benefits, they \\nare not a cure and cannot undo any permanent \\ndisability. Nonetheless, they can reduce how many \\nrelapses occur and how serious they are, and th ey can \\nalso slow down the damage caused by relapsing MS \\nthat builds up over time. The 34 available DMD/Ts for \\nMS have been abundantly analyzed in the case of the \\nvarious MS forms (relapsing remitting, secondary \\nprogressive, primary progressive) and for tre ating \\nrelapses (exacerbations). \\n \\nNon-pharmacological rehabilitation therapies \\n(multidisciplinary, cognitive, neurological, physical, \\noccupational, vocational, palliative, etc.) are also \\navailable but evidence for their effectiveness is \\ninsufficient to recommend them alone although their \\nuse in combination with medications may be \\nreasonable. Immunotherapies and stem cell therapies \\n(autologous, mesenchymal) are also available. \\nHowever, despite potent suppression of inflammation, \\nimmunotherapy benefit in the more important and \\ndisabling progressive phase is extremely limited so that \\nprogressive MS has emerged as the greatest clinical \\nand research challenge. Clinical trials have shown that \\ncell therapies are able to reduce relapses, however, \\ncompared to other DMD/Ts, they have among the \\nhighest risk of side effects, especially serious ones. \\nLastly, the prognosis of MS depends on the subtype of \\nthe disease with great individual variation. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1.

Now, \\ncomputer-assisted applications are increasingly intro-\\nduced to aid the diagnosis and quantification of dis-\\neases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Such \\nprocedures involve the analysis of epidemiological \\nand medical imaging data using artificial intelligence \\n(AI) to improve speed.\\nMRI, in particular, is fast becoming the imaging \\nmodality of choice for the diagnosis and monitoring of \\nMS, as it can be used to follow the dissemination of \\nlesions in both space and time, which is essential for \\nthe diagnosis following an initial clinical event.2 \\nCurrent guidelines recommend that brain MRIs be \\nperformed yearly as a way to guide treatment deci-\\nsions and prognoses for people with MS. AI research \\ntools are constantly improving and trying to reach the \\nstage where automated longitudinal analysis of MRI \\nimages can be used in clinical practice.3 According to \\nthe World Health Organization (WHO), there are more \\nthan 2 million people with MS globally, at an average \\nprevalence estimated to be 30 per 100,000 people and \\na rate that is increasing rapidly, especially in younger \\nage groups.4 Both the prevalence and incidence of MS \\nhave more than doubled over the last 15 years, while \\nthe last 50 years has seen a threefold increase in the \\nratio of female to male sufferers.

Recent \\nadvancements in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the improvements in the classifica-\\ntion, quantification and identification of diagnostic patterns in medical images for a range of diseases, in \\nparticular, for MS. Importantly, data generated using AI techniques are analyzed automatically, which \\ncompares favourably with labour-intensive and time-consuming manual methods.\\nObjective: The aim of this review is to assist MS researchers to understand current and future develop-\\nments in the AI-based diagnosis and prognosis of MS.\\nMethods: We will investigate a variety of AI approaches and various classifiers and compare the current \\nstate-of-the-art techniques in relation to lesion segmentation/detection and prognosis of disease. After \\nbriefly describing the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques commonly used, we will describe \\nAI techniques used for the detection of lesions and MS prognosis.\\nResults: We then evaluate the clinical maturity of these AI techniques in relation to MS.\\nConclusion: Finally, future research challenges are identified in a bid to encourage further improvements \\nof the methods.\\nKeywords: Multiple sclerosis, MRI, artificial intelligence, machine learning, medical imaging\\nDate received: 25 July 2020; revised: 22 September 2020; accepted: 23 September 2020.\\nCorrespondence to: \\nJ Lechner-Scott  \\nDepartment of Neurology, \\nJohn Hunter Hospital, \\nLookout Road, New Lambton \\nHeights, NSW 2305, \\nAustralia. \\nJeannette.LechnerScott@\\nhealth.nsw.gov.au\\nH.

AI has two main approaches: machine learning \\n(ML) and deep learning (DL). ML is used to analyze \\ndata, then learn from data and make decisions, \\nwhereas DL learns and makes decisions with the help \\nof layers of artificial neural networks.6\\nDL is a subclass of ML techniques. DL is normally \\nused for large-scale datasets. For smaller datasets, \\nML techniques are preferred. Also, ML uses hand-\\ncrafted features (derived using numerous algorithms \\nfrom the information existing in the image itself) to \\nlearn and make decisions, whereas DL techniques \\ncan learn features independently and decide on fine-\\ntuning according to the input data.7 In this article, dif-\\nferent ML and DL algorithms are discussed in relation \\nto segmentation and prognosis of MS, but our focus \\nwill be considering DL methods in particular, as they \\nare diagnostically more efficient. ML/DL can be \\nsupervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised. A \\ngeneral diagram of how AI is applied to MS is shown \\nin Figure 1.\\nLiterature review\\nWhereas ML has had a long association with the pro-\\ncessing of medical images, DL only started gaining \\ntraction in this field in 2018, as evidenced by the rapid \\nincrease in related publications over that year. Figure 2 \\nshows the increase in the number of related publica-\\ntions between 2011 and 2020, while information about \\npublications relating to the segmentation and progno-\\nsis of MS from the last 10 years has been combined in \\nTables 3–5, respectively.\\nSearch strategy\\nTo find literature pertaining to recent developments in \\nMS detection and prediction, the digital libraries \\nScienceDirect, MEDLINE, Association for Computing \\nMachinery (ACM), Elsevier and SpringerLink for \\npublications from 2011 onwards were searched using \\nthe keywords ‘Multiple Sclerosis’, ‘artificial intelli-\\ngence’, ‘Machine learning’ and ‘deep learning’. \\nResults were then cross-checked using queries through \\nScopus, Web of Science and PubMed. The search \\nreturned 126 papers, with 72 papers focusing on ML/\\nDL in relation to MS, removing non-English articles, \\npreprints and articles not specifically related to seg-\\nmentation or prognosis of MS.\\nMRI protocols helping AI\\nTo monitor disease activity, accurate measurement of \\nnumber and volume of lesions is required. MRI is the \\nonly technique that allows non-invasive quantifica-\\ntion and characterization of MS lesions in the brain \\nand spinal cord. Longitudinal MRIs are important not \\nonly in tracking disease progression and evaluating \\nthe effectiveness of new drugs during clinical trials \\nbut also in clinical practice. A number of MRI proto-\\ncols have been developed to highlight the range of tis-\\nsue characteristics.8 For example, to achieve the best \\ngeneral visualization of MS lesions, T1-weighted \\n(T1-w), T2-weighted (T2-w) and T2-weighted fluid-\\nattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images are \\nnormally used, whereas contrast (gadolinium – Gd) \\nis used to determine acute activity.

Those most \\ncommonly used for MS MRI analysis are shown in \\nFigure 6. The primary purpose of these methods is \\neither disease classification, detection/segmentation \\nor predicting the course of disease. Support vector \\nmachines (SVMs) are commonly used for classifying \\npatients as either diseased or non-diseased, whereas \\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used pri-\\nmarily for tasks, such as detection/segmentation. \\nOther methods shown in Figure 6 are used in a similar \\nway to CNNs but employ a different algorithm. These \\nare discussed in sections ‘Adoption of state-of-the-art \\nAI techniques by MS researchers’ and ‘Conclusion’.\\nRecent progress in AI for MS\\nA variety of methods have been developed for the \\ndetection/segmentation of MS lesions and for the \\nprognosis of disability in MS patients. First, each of \\nthese methods requires data collection, followed by \\npre-processing and then the application of ML/DL \\ntechniques.12\\nData collection\\nThe collection of data for AI research can be problem-\\natic for several reasons. First, MRI scans are expen-\\nsive, which limits the amount of data that can be \\ncollected by scans done purely for research purposes. \\nSecond, when using data from clinical scans, problems \\nwith non-uniformity due to differences in the types of \\nscanners, sequences used, slice thicknesses and time \\nintervals are a challenge for DL and ML techniques. \\nOne reason is that the unstructured data are more in \\nraw format than the structured data. Due to the com-\\nplexity of data, higher processing capacity is needed, \\nwhich is limiting the possibility of real-time analysis. \\nIn addition to this, there are ethical and privacy issues \\nassociated with the sharing of medical data.\\nTo overcome these issues, online datasets are made \\navailable for ML/DL researchers to apply their algo-\\nrithms. Perhaps, the most well-known of these are \\nthose associated with the International Symposium on \\nBiomedical Imaging (ISBI)13 and the Medical Image \\nComputing and Computer-Assisted Intervention \\n(MICCAI),14 both of which are available publicly for \\nqualitative as well as quantitative analysis of algo-\\nrithms.

Manually seg-\\nmented masks are provided as benchmarks for com-\\nparison. Both platforms are continually running \\nchallenges to foster improvement of algorithms.\\nPre-processing\\nThis process is required to clean the raw dataset \\nbefore being able to be used for analysis. Before ML/\\nDL techniques can be applied to an image, it is neces-\\nsary to first clean and standardize the data by pre-pro-\\ncessing it, so that the algorithm can be allowed to run \\noptimally. The most frequently used among these are \\nimage denoising, skull stripping, intensity normaliza-\\ntion and image registration, which were also used in \\nthe available datasets above.\\nML/DL techniques\\nAfter the data are pre-processed, different ML/DL can \\nbe applied. ML techniques, such as SVM, are gener-\\nally used for the classification of MS disease, whereas \\nDL techniques, such as CNNs (further consisting of \\n2D-CNNs and 3D-CNNs), recurrent neural networks \\n(RNNs), deep reinforcement learning (DRLs) and \\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs), are applied \\nfor the segmentation and prognosis of MS disease.\\nML/DL algorithms fall into one of the two basic cate-\\ngories: supervised or unsupervised.15 Supervised learn-\\ning needs labelled dataset to evaluate the accuracy of \\ntraining data, whereas unsupervised learning can be \\ntrained on unlabelled data and it extracts patterns and \\nfeatures on its own. To date, detection/segmentation \\nand prediction have been performed mostly by super-\\nvised learning techniques. According to Adhikary \\net al.,16 supervised learning is more commonly being \\nused because it does not require handcrafted features \\nfor training purposes. A review of studies done over the \\nlast 10 years has revealed 2D-CNN to be the most com-\\nmonly used technique for the detection/segmentation \\nor prognosis of MS (see Figure 7).\\nDetection/segmentation of MS lesions.

Then \\nthey applied FAST-trimmed likelihood estimator to \\nmake decisions of rejection of voxels without lesions \\nusing T1-w, T2-w and FLAIR images.

Several algorithms37–41 have been \\ndeveloped for this specific purpose. They range from \\nsimple linear discriminant classifiers to the state-of-\\nthe-art CNNs. Ion et al.37 created an algorithm that \\nhelped to classify MS courses using a Gaussian kernel \\nwith the help of an SVM for the magnetic resonance \\nspectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and segmentation fea-\\ntures of brain tissues and were able to achieve up to \\n95% efficiency. MRSI is an important technique that \\ncombines spectroscopic and imaging techniques. It \\ncan help with the assessment of neurochemical \\nchanges in the brain and can therefore improve our \\nunderstanding of the pathological mechanism of MS. \\nZhao et al.38 proposed an algorithm for the prediction \\nof disease course in MS. They used SVM, specifically, \\na traditional ML technique for prediction. They also \\nimplemented logistic regression (LG) with linear and \\nnon-linear filters. This algorithm was tested on one of \\nthe larger clinical datasets, the Comprehensive Longi-\\ntudinal MS trial at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital \\n(CLIMB) study, consisting of 1693 patients. They \\nachieved 71% of sensitivity and 68% of specificity. \\nSeveral prognosis algorithms are mentioned in Table 5.\\nAdoption of the state-of-the-art AI techniques \\nby MS researchers\\nAI techniques in the field to date\\nThis section focuses on DL state-of-the-art techniques \\nwhich are being used for different purposes, such as \\nsegmentation/detection and prognosis of MS disease. \\nThe CNNs most commonly used in MS are AlexNet,36 \\nVGG,37 ResNet, 38 GoogLeNet 39 and CifarNet. 40 \\nThese DL techniques are used for either detection/\\nsegmentation or for the prognosis of disease.

ResNet – the \\nresidual network – is much deeper again than VGG. \\nCifarNet performs similar tasks to AlexNet but is \\narchitecturally different and has a much better accu-\\nracy than AlexNet. GoogLeNet, the winner of the \\nILSVRC 2014 competition, has an error rate of \\n6.67%, which is considered to be comparable to \\nhuman accuracy. Each of these networks is helping in \\nthe detection of diseases, such as MS.\\nAs already mentioned, challenge websites, such as \\nISBI and MICCAI, are also playing an important role \\nin the improvement of disease diagnostics. One of the \\nalgorithms in this challenge was developed by Brosch \\net al. using DL in the segmentation of MS lesions. \\nThis approach comprises a 3D-CNN model that learns \\nhierarchical representation of features with a convolu-\\ntional pathway and some unpooling layers with a \\ndeconvolutional pathway. These convolutional layers \\nare used for the calculation of features for segmenta-\\ntion. When compared to other methods, this method \\nwas shown to be superior in terms of absolute volume \\ndifference, DSC and false-positive rate.\\nA new algorithm for predicting the course of disease \\nin MS patients was developed by Zhao et al.38 using \\nclinical data relating to expanded disability status \\nscores (EDSS) collected every 6 months for the \\nCLIMB study. The Comprehensive Longitudinal MS \\ntrial at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Partners \\nMS Centre (CLIMB) has been enrolling patients since \\n2000. At the time of writing, this dataset consisted of \\n1693 patients with an average age of 43.88 years. \\nThese comprised 1228 females and 465 males. \\nHowever, 919 of these patients had an EDSS score \\nof ⩽1.5, 539 patients had an EDSS score of between \\n2 and 4, while 235 patients had an EDSS score of ⩾4. \\nThey investigated different ML algorithms, including \\nSVM, LG and SVMs with linear and non-linear fil-\\nters, with the objective of classifying MS patients as \\neither stable or deteriorating after 5 years of follow-\\nup. They found that ML algorithms, such as LG and \\nSVMs, were best in predicting EDSS after the first \\nyear, reporting a specificity of 65% and a sensitivity \\nof 62%. When data from the second year were \\nincluded, these figures increased to 68% and 71%, \\nrespectively.\\nTheir later use of non-uniform classification resulted \\nin improvements of up to 86%. An ML platform \\ndeveloped by the data analytics company IQuity can \\nidentify MS and then predict and monitor disease pro-\\ngression even for large cohorts of patients.\\nFuture developments\\nMost existing algorithms need improvement with \\nareas, such as image retrieval, management of phys-\\nical objects with long short-term memory (LSTMs), \\nAI surgical robots, prognostication and reinforce-\\nment learning still needing a lot of attention. \\nGenerative adversarial networks (GAN) based on \\nMS MRI data are being proposed which is remark-\\nable in itself. This technique is used to generate new \\ndata that have the same characteristics and statistics \\nas the training set. CNNs and GAN can help to \\ndetect lesions without the need of Gd and can thus \\ncreate a much cheaper and – for the patients – a \\nmuch safer approach.\\nA study by Gong et al.9 involved a reduced dose of Gd \\nin contrast-enhanced MS MRI scans analyzed with \\nthe help of DL. Their methodology involved the col-\\nlection of two contrast-enhanced datasets from each \\nof 60 patients, one collected after a full dose of Gd \\nand the other after low dose of Gd. Each dataset was \\nthen analyzed for active lesions being detected in the \\nlow-dose Gd scans. More specifically, by applying \\ntheir algorithm, up to 90% less Gd could be used with \\nno resultant significant degradation in image quality. \\nIt is hoped that in the future, the use of GAN will \\nallow Gd to be omitted from the procedure entirely, \\nwhich will thus lead to improvements in scanning \\ntimes and cost-effectiveness.\\nConclusion\\nAI algorithms have had a major impact on medical \\nimaging with new doors being opened in the identifi-\\ncation of textural and morphological patterns. This \\nimpact has been keenly felt particularly in the study of \\nMS, a complex disease characterized by substantial \\nphenotypic variation that occurs due to environmental \\nand genetic factors. ML/DL has delivered exceptional \\nperformance across several applications in the diag-\\nnosis of MS, with improvements being noted in the \\ndetection and segmentation of lesions, early detection \\nof disease and prognosis for MS patients. SVMs, \\nregression techniques and more advanced techniques, \\nsuch as CNNs, are examples of ML that have been \\napplied in the study of MS. Different AI techniques, \\nsuch as SVM, CNN, LG, and RF, as shown in Figures \\n6 and 7, have helped the medical field to either clas-\\nsify disease, to detect lesions and segment tissue, or \\npredict the course of disease. These approaches will \\nmake the diagnosis of MS and prediction of disease \\noutcome easier and more efficient for neurologists \\nwhich ultimately will lead to improved outcomes for \\npatients.'),\n",

Hauser, MD\\nObjective: Rates of worsening and evolution to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) may be substantially\\nlower in actively treated patients compared to natural history studies from the pretreatment era. Nonetheless, in our\\nrecently reported prospective cohort, more than half of patients with relapsing MS accumulated signiﬁcant new disabil-\\nity by the 10th year of follow-up. Notably,“no evidence of disease activity” at 2 years did not predict long-term stabil-\\nity. Here, we determined to what extent clinical relapses and radiographic evidence of disease activity contribute to\\nlong-term disability accumulation.\\nMethods:Disability progression was deﬁned as an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.5, 1.0, or 0.5\\n(or greater) from baseline EDSS = 0, 1.0–5.0, and 5.5 or higher, respectively, assessed from baseline to year 5 (/C6 1y e a r )\\nand sustained to year 10 (/C6 1 year). Longitudinal analysis of relative brain volume loss used a linear mixed model with sex,\\nage, disease duration, andHLA-DRB1*15:01 as covariates.\\nResults: Relapses were associated with a transient increase in disability over 1-year intervals (p = 0.012) but not with\\nconﬁrmed disability progression (p = 0.551). Relative brain volume declined at a greater rate among individuals with\\ndisability progression compared to those who remained stable (p < 0.05).\\nInterpretation: Long-term worsening is common in relapsing MS patients, is largely independent of relapse activity,\\nand is associated with accelerated brain atrophy. We propose the termsilent progressionto describe the insidious dis-\\nability that accrues in many patients who satisfy traditional criteria for relapsing–remitting MS.\\nANN NEUROL 2019;85:653–666\\nO\\nne of the deﬁning clinical features for many multiple\\nsclerosis (MS) patients is relapses— episodes of neuro-\\nlogical worsening that evolve over hours or days and then last\\nfor days or weeks, followed by varying degrees of recovery.1\\nMS relapses are typically accompanied by radiographic\\nchanges on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) such as the\\ndevelopment of new lesions on T2-weighted imaging or new\\ncontrast-enhancing lesions.2 Relapses contribute to meaning-\\nful neurological disability over the short term3; however,\\nwhether relapses also contribute substantially to long-term\\ndisability is controversial.

We\\nsought to test the 2-stage hypothesis of disability progression\\nby deﬁning the contribution of relapses and radiographic dis-\\nease activity to long-term disability and brain atrophy using\\na well-phenotyped, University of California, San Francisco\\n(UCSF) MS-EPIC (expression/genomics, proteomics, imag-\\ning, and clinical) dataset.\\nThe MS-EPIC dataset is a single-center prospective\\nobservational cohort of contemporary, actively treated MS\\npatients who have been evaluated annually since July 2004\\nwith long-term data ascertained in 91% of study partici-\\npants. We previously reported that rates of worsening and\\nevolution to secondary progressive MS (SPMS) were sub-\\nstantially lower when compared to natural history studies\\nfrom the pretreatment era. Nonetheless, more than half of\\npatients with relapsing MS accumulated signiﬁcant new dis-\\nability after 1 decade of follow-up.26 Notably, no evidence\\nof disease activity (NEDA) at 2 years did not predict long-\\nterm stability. Because over half of the relapsing–remitting\\n(RRMS) patients in the EPIC dataset developed clinically\\nsigniﬁcant disability worsening by 10 years, but were still\\nconsidered by their treating physicians to have relapsing\\nMS (ie, they had not been reclassiﬁed as having developed\\nsecondary progressive disease), we sought to determine\\nwhether ongoing relapse activity, assessed clinically as\\nrelapses or radiographically as new or enlarging focal white\\nmatter lesions, might be the primary contributor to this\\nlong-term disability worsening. We also sought to deter-\\nmine to what extent relapsing activity contributes to evolu-\\ntion of brain atrophy— an in vivo measure of irreversible\\ntissue injury that correlates with long-term disability.\\nPatients and Methods\\nThe UCSF EPIC cohort is a prospective, longitudinal,\\nactively treated, single-center cohort of patients, now in its\\n14th year of follow-up. The UCSF Institutional Review\\nBoard reviewed and approved the study protocol. Written\\ninformed consent was obtained for all participants. This\\nstudy was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of\\nHelsinki. The 10-year, postbaseline follow-up of this cohort\\nwas previously reported.26 Although the cohort enrolled par-\\nticipants with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), RRMS,\\nSPMS, and primary progressive MS, here we considered\\nonly those participants who had either CIS or RRMS at\\nentry. For baseline data, the annualized relapse rate (ARR;\\nlife-time) was calculated from when theﬁrst relapse occurred\\nto baseline in the patient self-reported database. At end of\\nstudy, the ARR was calculated from baseline to last visit. If\\nmissing data were due to MS disability in Multiple Sclerosis\\nFunctional Composite (MSFC) assessment, then 99 seconds\\nwas used in the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), 300 sec-\\no n d sw a su s e di nt h e9 - H o l eP e gT e s t( 9 H P T ) ,a n d0s c o r e s\\nwere used for the 3-second Paced Auditory Serial Addition\\nTest (PASAT) and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test\\n(SDMT). R median algorithm (type 7) was used to calculate\\nmedian and interquartile scores. Some patients had partial\\nvisits due to missing MSFC at last follow-up. In this case,\\nthe most recent available MSFC visit was used.\\nAs previously reported,26 clinically signiﬁcant disability\\nwas deﬁned as worsening by an increase in the Expanded\\nDisability Status Scale (EDSS)27 of 1.5 points if the baseline\\nEDSS score was 0, 1.0 point if the baseline EDSS score was\\nbetween 1.0 and 5.0, and 0.5 point for baseline EDSS\\nscores of 5.5 or higher. Relapses were patient-reported and\\nassessed systematically for the year prior at each annual visit.\\nRelapses were deﬁned as new, focal neurological symptoms\\nevolving over days to weeks that lasted for >24 hours, were\\nnot associated with an intercurrent infection, and were typi-\\ncally followed by at least partial recovery of function over\\ntime. Examples of relapses included vision loss, double vision,\\nweakness in one or more limbs, sensory disturbances includ-\\ning paresthesias, or loss of coordination including imbalance.\\nSymptoms that were nonspeciﬁc such as headache, malaise,\\nand generalized weakness or were insidious and progressive in\\nnature were not considered relapses. To assess the effect\\nof relapses on disability, we compared 1-year intervals, with\\ndisability assessments performed annually.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Carlini\\\\OneDrive - Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna\\\\Articoli\\\\MS\\\\Annals of Neurology - 2019 -  - Silent progression in disease activity free relapsing multiple sclerosis.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='interval, a short-term impact of relapse on MS disability was\\ndeﬁned as an increase in EDSS between the 2 annual visits\\nduring a year in which a relapse occurred. As such, each sub-\\nject was considered serially for annual assessment of the\\nimpact of relapses on MS disability. Conﬁrmed disability was\\ndeﬁned as worsening maintained for 2 consecutive annual\\nvisits. Lastly, long-term worsening was deﬁned as increase in\\ndisability between baseline and the midpoint of the study\\n(median years = 5, range = 4–6), with conﬁrmation of wors-\\nening 5 years thereafter (sustained worsening).\\nDisability was also assessed using the T25FW, 9HPT,\\nand PASAT. Because the SDMT became generally available\\nfor MS studies during the course of the study, this test of\\ncognitive function was performed after the 5th study year.\\nClinically meaningful worsening was deﬁned as a 20%\\nincrease in the T25FW (average of 2 trials), a 20% increase\\nin the 9HPT time for either arm (single trial), an increase in\\nthe reliable change index for the PASAT, and a 4-point\\nworsening in the SDMT. The contribution of relapse to dis-\\nability was determined by Pearson chi-squared test with\\nYates continuity correction or Fisher exact test.\\nTo simplify the analysis of treatment on relapses, we\\ngrouped therapies into 2 tiers:“platform” (eg, interferons,\\nglatiramer acetate) and“high-potency therapy”(eg, natalizumab,\\nmitoxantrone, rituximab, cyclophosphamide).26 We also consid-\\nered a 3-tiered model grouping together therapies by relative\\nrelapse rate reduction: modest (interferons, glatiramer ace-\\ntate, teriﬂunomide), moderate (ﬁngolimod, dimethyl fu-\\nmarate), and high (natalizumab, anti-CD20 monoclonal\\nantibodies, alemtuzumab) efﬁcacy. However, because oral\\ntreatment options and other monoclonal antibodies were not\\ngenerally available during theﬁrst 6 years of the study, we\\npresent the simpler, 2-tiered model. Multivariate logistic\\nregression was used to model the impact of treatment tier on\\nrelapses, with disease duration, disease course, andHLA-\\nDRB1*15:01 included as covariates.HLA-DRB1*15:01 was\\nincluded in this and other analyses because we previously\\nreported an effect of this allele on certain clinical features of\\nMS.28,29 Age-adjusted baseline brain volume was calculated\\nby regression (baseline brain volume ~ age + sex + disease\\nduration) and was divided into quartiles. Logistic regression\\nwas used to assess relationships between long-term disability\\nworsening and age-adjusted brain volume. A linear mixed\\nmodel was developed to consider the impact of relapses and\\ndisability worsening on relative brain volume loss. Four\\nsubject groups were considered: (1) participants with\\nincreased disability but without relapses, (2) participants\\nwithout increased disability and without relapses, (3) partici-\\npants with increased disability and with relapses, and\\n(4) participants without increased disability but with\\nrelapses. The annual percentage change in relative brain vol-\\nume is deﬁned as the slope of follow-up year divided by the\\nrelative brain volume at baseline. If brain volume is a0 and\\ncerebrospinalﬂuid (CSF) is b0 at time 0, and brain volume is\\na10 and CSF is b10 at time 10, then the percentage change of\\nbrain volume is (a10 − a0)/1 0/a 0 = a10−a0\\n10a0 . The percent\\nchange of relative brain volume is (a10 /[ a10 +b 10] − a0 /\\n[a0 +b 0]) / 10 / (a0 /[ a0 +b 0]) = a10b0−a0b10\\n10a0 a10 + b10ðÞ . The ratio of\\npercentage change of brain volume to the percentage\\nchange of relative brain volume is (a10 − a0)(a10 +b 10)/\\n(a10b0 − a0b10). In this dataset, the ratio of relative brain vol-\\nume to percentage change in brain volume is 5- to 6-fold.\\nTo assess the effect of new brain lesions on silent pro-\\ngression and on brain atrophy in treated and untreated partici-\\npants, 4 subgroups were identiﬁed: (1) treated participants\\nwithout new lesions (new T2 or Gd+), (2) treated participants\\nwith new lesions, (3) untreated participants without new\\nlesions, and (4) untreated participants with new lesions. Logis-\\ntic regression was used to identify inﬂuences on disability and\\na linear mixed model for brain atrophy.\\nThe MRI acquisition protocol and analytic pipelines\\nwere previously published.26 Brieﬂy, Lesion Segmentation\\nTool30 was used to segment lesion onﬂuid-attenuated inver-\\nsion recovery images and corrected using the Mind Control\\nplatform.31 These lesions were used as input to SIENAX32\\nusing optibet33 for brain extraction. Registration and multi-\\nnormal segmentation methods were used to propagate\\nlesions backward and forward within a subject over time\\n(unpublished methods). Gadolinium-enhancing lesions were\\nvisually assessed on postcontrast T1-weighted MRI. Gado-\\nlinium was not routinely administered for all brain MRI\\nstudies at long-term follow-up.\\nResults\\nRelapses Are Associated with Short-Term but\\nNot Conﬁrmed or Long-Term Disability\\nWorsening\\nThe baseline characteristics of this cohort are described in\\nTable 1. Of 480 RRMS or CIS participants assessed at\\nbaseline, 407 completed visits through year 5 /C6 1y e a r\\n(43 participants missed this visit, 28 withdrew from the\\nstudy, 2 participants died). Of the 43 participants who\\nmissed the year 5 visit/C6 1 year, 33 returned to complete\\nthe year 10 visit.

At baseline, a signi ﬁcant\\neffect on relative brain volume loss was observed only in\\nthe group of subjects with worsening disability and relapses.\\nAge at baseline, disease duration at baseline, male sex, and\\nyears of follow-up were all associated with decline in relative\\nbrain volume loss. The interaction term of subject group\\nwith years of observation in the study was signiﬁcant for all\\n3 groups relative to the reference group of clinically stable\\nparticipants (without disability worsening and without\\nrelapses). This interaction term indicates that each subject\\ngroup modiﬁes the impact of time on relative brain volume\\nloss. That the interaction terms for all groups relative to clini-\\ncally stable patients (those without worsening disability and\\nwithout relapses) was signiﬁcant indicates that patient group\\nmodiﬁes the effect of time on relative brain volume loss.\\nTherefore, the rates of relative brain volume loss for partici-\\npants with either relapses or increasing disability are signiﬁ-\\ncantly greater than the rate found in clinically quiescent\\nparticipants (Fig 3, Table 5). Signiﬁcant differences were\\nfound for comparisons between the“stable disability without\\nrelapse”and “increased disability without relapse,”“increased\\ndisability with relapse,” and “stable disability with relapse”\\ngroups, but no differences were observed for other compari-\\nsons. The most statistically signiﬁcant comparison is for the\\ngroup of subjects who experienced increased disability with-\\nout relapse in comparison to the group of subjects who were\\nclinically stable. Nonsigniﬁcant p values suggest that there is\\nno difference between the 2 groups being compared on rates\\nof relative brain volume loss. Although relapses may contrib-\\nute to relative brain volume loss in subjects without increas-\\ning disability (p = 0.027), there was no apparent additional\\nimpact of relapses in the group of subjects with worsening\\ndisability (p = 0.486). Similarly, there was no apparent addi-\\ntional impact of increased disability in the group of subjects\\nwith relapses (p = 0.999).\\nThe baseline brain parenchymal fraction was not sig-\\nniﬁcantly different between the 4 groups, and, over the\\ncourse of the study, brain volume declined in each group.\\nIn considering the group of patients who did not experi-\\nence relapses during theﬁrst 6 years of the study, relative\\nbrain volume declined at a more pronounced rate in partic-\\nipants whose disability progressed compared to those who\\nremained stable (see Fig 3). Among these nonrelapsing par-\\nticipants, CSF volume marginally increased in participants\\nwho experienced long-term increased disability (p = 0.022,\\nnonsigniﬁcant following multiple comparison correction).\\nChanges in T2 lesion volume, white matter volume, gray\\nmatter volume, cortical gray matter volume, and brain vol-\\nume were similar between these 2 groups.\\nBaseline Brain Volume and Disability Progression\\nSeveral models were developed to determine whether greater\\nbaseline age-adjusted brain atrophy placed participants at\\ngreater risk for disability. Results indicated that age-adjusted\\nbaseline brain atrophy was associated with both an increased\\nrisk of long-term disability (Supplementary Table 3) and silent\\nprogression (Supplementary Table 4).

Moreover,\\nduring the relapsing phase, disability measures are con-\\nfounded by clinical attacks followed by variable recovery.\\nAll of these factors can obscure recognition of an underly-\\ning neurodegenerative process that we labeledsilent progres-\\nsion to highlight its subtle emergence over the course of\\nRRMS. It seems likely that the same underlying process\\nthat causes silent progression is responsible for SPMS when\\nthe march of clinical worsening is more evident. In this\\nregard, it is notable that patients experiencing silent pro-\\ngression had accelerated brain atrophy over the long-term\\ncourse of the EPIC study, as well as more age-adjusted\\nbrain atrophy at the time of their initial enrollment.\\nOur data are consistent with 2 simultaneous pro-\\ncesses; one results in the appearance of new focal demye-\\nlinating lesions visible on brain MRI that correlate with\\nrelapses, and the other is more diffuse and contributes to\\nbrain atrophy. This second process of global tissue injury\\nis largely independent of relapses or focal lesion formation\\nand appears to represent the most important contributor\\nto long-term MS disability. That brain volume loss occurs\\nearly in MS and correlates with long-term disability was\\nshown in prior studies.35–37 However, uncertainty remains\\nas to whether this process is dependent or independent of\\nthe development of new focal lesions. Because we found\\nno correlation of new brain MRI lesions with long-term\\ndisability, our data are more consistent with the hypothe-\\nsis that either diffuse injury or perhaps focal lesions too\\nsmall to be detected by current methods lead to irrevers-\\nible tissue loss.\\nThe pathologic substrate responsible for progressive tis-\\nsue injury in MS is likely to result from some combination of\\na white matter axonopathy and direct neuronal injury. Slowly\\nenlarging white matter lesions associated with chronic inﬂam-\\nmation at the leading edge is one possible mechanism for pro-\\ngressive symptoms, and more diffuse injury might also play a\\nrole.38 Histopathological studies in chronic MS show that focal\\ninﬂammatory changes, microglial activation, and astrocytosis\\ntypically accompany axonopathy and myelin injury.39–41\\nFurthermore, chronic demyelination appears to predispose\\naxons to early death.42 In addition, ectopic B-cell–containing\\nimmune aggregates located in the overlying meninges and in\\nVirchow–Robin perivascular spaces could contribute to pro-\\ngressive cortical injury. Thus, histopathological studies support\\na model in which both microscopic and macroscopic tissue\\ninjury occur with CNS inﬂammation.\\nThese data also indicate that silent progression is not an\\ninvariable accompaniment of RRMS, and that measurement\\nof whole brain atrophy might serve as a surrogate marker to\\nidentify patients with insidiously progressive ongoing disabil-\\nity. Incorporating a threshold for preservation of brain volume\\nwas proposed as a component for no evidence of disease activ-\\nity (NEDA-4).43 For ﬁngolimod-treated patients, incorporat-\\ning a minimal acceptable threshold for preservation of brain\\nvolume reduced the proportion of patients meeting the\\nNEDA criteria from 31% for NEDA-3 to 19.7% for\\nNEDA-4, underscoring the remaining unmet need for thera-\\npies that are more effective in arresting axonopathy and brain\\nvolume loss than current treatments.\\nRegulatory agencies have approved more than a dozen\\ntherapies for treatment of RRMS. All are proven, with vary-\\ning degrees of efﬁcacy, to reduce the occurrence of clinical\\nrelapses and prevent development of focal lesions measured\\non brain MRI. For the most part, the selection of which\\ntreatment to use is based on these measures of efﬁcacy as\\nwell as consideration of safety and tolerability. Our observa-\\ntion that tissue injury distinct from focal white matter\\nlesions underlies long-term disability in RRMS suggests that\\ntreatment selection should also consider the impact on silent\\nprogression and on associated measures of brain atrophy.\\nImportantly, recent studies indicate that the high-efﬁcacy\\ntherapies natalizumab44 and ocrelizumab45 reduce progres-\\nsion independent of relapse activity in RRMS, although\\nthese effects were partial. Additional studies are needed to\\ndetermine whether long-term beneﬁts on disability preven-\\ntion are mediated by prevention of brain volume loss.\\nOur conclusions in regard to the impact of relapses on\\nlong-term disability are consistent with those from the British\\nColumbia cohort7 but appear to diverge from the observations\\nfrom MSBase.13 O n ee x p l a n a t i o nf o rt h i sd i f f e r e n c ec o u l db e\\nsample size. The MSBase group drew their conclusions from\\na larger dataset of 2,466 relapsing onset participants and has\\ngreater power to detect predictors of long-term disability with\\nsmall effect sizes. However, advantages of the current EPIC\\nstudy are its prospective ascertainment, systematic MRI acqui-\\nsition and analysis, and a high rate of retention that reduces\\nthe impact of bias introduced by missing information from\\nparticipants lost to follow-up. The mean annual relapse\\nfrequency was slightly higher in MSBase than EPIC (0.36\\ncompared with 0.25,p < 0.001), possibly increasing the long-\\nterm effect of attacks on disability. Differences in prescribing\\npractice between these datasets could also play a role, as treat-\\nment likely inﬂuences not only relapse frequency but also\\nrelapse severity. The methods used for assessing the impact of\\nrelapses on long-term disability between these 2 studies are\\nalso different; in EPIC we used a minimal threshold for dis-\\nability worsening from our baseline observation and correlated\\nrelapse occurrence with both short-term and long-term dis-\\nability worsening, whereas MSBase used a linear-regression\\nmodel that considered the impact of the ARR over the\\n10 years of study on median 10-year EDSS change.\\nMay 2019 663\\nCree et al.: Disability in Relapsing MS\\n 15318249, 2019, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.25463 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [13/08/2024].

Participants in this study had higher\\nrelapse rates (1.2 ARR) and baseline EDSS scores (3.0),\\nindicating that this cohort was more clinically active and\\nhad worse disability compared to the EPIC dataset. At the\\ntime of the pivotal interferonβ-1b trial, therapeutic\\noptions for escalation treatment were limited. Perhaps\\neven more importantly, these studies used different ana-\\nlytic methods: the interferonβ-1b long-term follow-up\\nstudy assessed whether the ARR during theﬁrst 2 years of\\nthe study correlated with increased EDSS by year 16.\\nWhen relapses have been correlated with long-term dis-\\nability, their impact typically was observed primarily during\\nthe ﬁrst 2 to 5 years from disease onset.8–12 With earlier diag-\\nnosis of MS based on evolving diagnostic criteria and hence\\nearlier treatment, it seems likely that many patients with high\\nrelapse frequency would be treated with disease-modifying\\ntherapies, thereby attenuating the association between early\\nfrequent relapses and long-term disability. Given that the\\nmean disease duration at baseline in the EPIC dataset was\\n7.6 years (see Table 1), the majority of the observations\\nregarding relapses in this dataset occur after theﬁrst 5 years of\\ndisease onset. Therefore, due to differences in the windows of\\nobservation, ourﬁnding that relapses do not contribute to\\nlong-term disability may be consistent with these prior studies.\\nLastly, ourﬁndings should not be interpreted to suggest that\\nMS relapses are without clinical signiﬁcance. Within this\\ndataset, in addition to the impact of relapses on short-term\\ndisability, there are circumstances in which severe relapses cau-\\nsed permanent disability (data not shown). Rather, our results\\nargue that long-term disability in RRMS is not primarily\\ndriven by cumulative injury from relapses.\\nOur study has several limitations. We were not able\\nto identify a statistically signiﬁcant impact of treatment on\\nlong-term disability or brain volume loss; however, this\\ndataset is likely underpowered to detect small treatment\\neffects mediated through reduction of new white matter\\nlesions detected by MRI. In addition to the relatively small\\nsize of our dataset, information on relapses was patient-\\nreported and thus is not directly comparable to clinician-\\nvalidated relapses obtained from controlled clinical trials.\\nIn the clinical trial setting, participants are assessed within a\\ndeﬁned window of relapse onset, and relapses are deﬁned by\\nan objective change in EDSS score. Such rigorous relapse\\nassessment was beyond the scope of our study, which was\\ndesigned for long-term characterization of the MS phenotype.\\nWe therefore relied on patient-reported relapses that were\\nassessed through structured interview. When our participants\\nwere clustered by factor analysis of mixed data (see Fig 2), par-\\nticipants with the same relapse frequency grouped together,\\nsuggesting validity of self-reported relapses. Moreover, in the\\nCombiRx study, the impact of treatment on patient-reported\\nrelapses was similar to that of protocol-deﬁned relapses,\\nsuggesting that patient-reported relapses are likely valid.47\\nAnother potential limitation is the possibility that focal gray\\nmatter lesions or spinal cord lesions, not quantiﬁed in this\\nstudy, could contribute to long-term disability. Finally, results\\nobtained from any single-center design may not be replicated\\nin other datasets. Work is underway to address this issue; we\\nhave partnered with other groups who have similar deeply\\nphenotyped long-term datasets for the purpose of increasing\\nstatistical power and performing validation studies for these\\nand other observations.48 Despite these limitations, the char-\\nacteristics of this dataset are consistent with previously publi-\\nshed observations in that MS relapses were associated with\\nnew lesions on brain MRI and were associated with increased\\nshort-term MS disability.2,3 The consistency of ourﬁndings\\nregarding short-term outcomes lends credence to our longer-\\nterm observations.\\nIn summary, the high degree of effectiveness of MS\\ntherapies against clinical attacks and new white matter lesions\\nmade it possible to prospectively assess long-term outcomes in\\nRRMS when these elements of focal disease were silenced.\\nThe appearance of silent progression during the RRMS phase\\nand its association with brain atrophy suggest that the same\\nprocess that underlies SPMS likely begins far earlier than is\\ngenerally recognized and support a unitary view of MS biol-\\nogy, with both focal and diffuse tissue destructive components,\\nand with inﬂammation and neurodegeneration occurring\\nthroughout the disease spectrum.In addition to brain atrophy,\\nother markers of neural degeneration, such as quantitative spi-\\nnal cord imaging,49 optical coherence tomography,50 and\\nserum neuroﬁlament light chains,51 may also prove useful in\\nidentifying patients with silent progression. Moreover, as\\nrelapses and focal white matter lesions are brought under\\nexcellent control by disease-modifying therapies for RRMS,\\nthe effectiveness of these agents against silent progression is\\nlikely to represent a key determinant of their relative value.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n(R01NS26799 to S.L.H. and J.R.O.), the Valhalla Founda-\\ntion, and gifts from Friends of the Multiple Sclerosis\\nResearch Group at UCSF supported this study.\\nWe thank the patients for their long-term participa-\\ntion in this ambitious study and A.

Given the profound burden of progres-\\nsive multiple sclerosis, and the recent development of effective treatments for these patients, there is a need to estab-\\nlish measures capable of identifying progressive multiple sclerosis early in the disease course. Starting from recent\\npathologicalﬁndings, this review assesses the state of the art of potential measures able to predict progressive multi-\\nple sclerosis. Future promising biomarkers that might shed light on mechanisms of progression are also discussed.\\nFinally, expansion of the concept of progressive multiple sclerosis, by including an assessment of cognition, patient-\\nreported outcomes, and comorbidities, is considered.\\nANN NEUROL 2020;88:438–452\\nIntroduction\\nProgressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) is characterized by\\nchronic inﬂammation, demyelination, oxidative stress, and\\nneurodegeneration that promote a gradual, progressive\\nand irreversible accumulation of neurological deﬁcits.1\\nThis clinical disability occurs independently from disease\\nactivity and is only partially prevented by available disease-\\nmodifying treatments.2\\nAlthough about 10 to 15% of multiple sclerosis\\n(MS) patients present with a progressive course from dis-\\nease onset (ie, primary progressive MS [PPMS]), more fre-\\nquently the disease is characterized by an initial relapsing–\\nremitting phase (relapsing – remitting MS [RRMS])\\nfollowed by evolution to secondary progressive MS\\n(SPMS).3 In addition to possible worsening of disability,\\ndisease activity (clinical relapses or new magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging [MRI] lesions) can also occur in PMS.3\\nThe identiﬁcation of progression in MS, that is, the\\ngradual and irreversible worsening of disability and neu-\\nrodegeneration, is on clinical grounds, and is retrospective.\\nHowever, there are currently no universally accepted\\ncriteria, and the classiﬁcation of a patient as progressive is\\noften delayed by months or even years. 4,5 Given the\\nexpanding number of MS treatments and the recent avail-\\nability of drugs that are approved for PMS patients,2 there\\nis the need to establish measures capable of identifying\\nMS progression early and monitoring its evolution.

The main goal was to review candidate\\nmeasures for identifying PMS through a critical reappraisal\\nof pathological, clinical, neuroimaging, and biological\\nstudies aimed at deﬁning biomarkers for the identiﬁcation\\nof MS progression. Important challenges and questions\\nthat could be particularly relevant for PMS patients and\\nstill require signiﬁcant effort were also discussed.\\nTable 1 summarizes our search strategy and selection\\ncriteria of the references that were collected and reviewed\\nin preparation for the meeting, discussed in a series of pre-\\nsentations and used for this review.\\nPathology\\nFocal white matter (WM) lesions, characterized by lym-\\nphocytic inﬂammation, demyelination, variable axonal\\nloss, and reactive gliosis, are the hallmark of MS pathol-\\nogy. They can be divided into 4 types: active lesions with\\nprofound inﬂammation and blood – brain barrier (BBB)\\ndamage; chronic active, smoldering, or slowly expanding\\nlesions (SELs); inactive lesions; and remyelinated shadow\\nplaques (Fig 1).6,7 Active lesions were most frequently\\nseen in RRMS patients and in patients who died within\\n1 year of disease onset. Chronic active SELs are character-\\nized by a slow rate of peripheral ongoing demyelination\\nand axonal loss, associated with a rim of activated\\nmicroglia/macrophages, which are loaded with iron in\\nabout half of these lesions.8 SELs were originally described\\nto be more frequent in PMS patients, 6,7 but are also\\nfound in RRMS, when larger case cohorts are analyzed.6,7\\nBecause patients with a more aggressive disease showed a\\nhigher prevalence of SELs, their presence could identify\\npatients with a more severe disease course, independently\\nfrom the phase of the disease.7 The incidence of shadow\\nplaques was similar in all MS courses, although highly var-\\niable between individual patients. 9 The variability in\\nremyelination depends on several factors; substantial\\nremyelination is frequently observed during the earlier\\nphases of MS and in younger individuals, whereas it is\\nmore sparse or absent in PMS, thus suggesting more lim-\\nited repair abilities.10 Due to the limited number of\\npatients who died in the relapsing – remitting stage, it\\nremains unclear whether or when there is a change in\\nlesion composition in RRMS patients before they clini-\\ncally convert to PMS.\\nExtensive focal demyelination in the gray matter\\n(GM) and diffuse neurodegeneration in the normal-appe-\\naring WM and GM have also been described.11 Lesions\\nmay arise in deep GM, spinal cord, or cerebral or\\ncerebellar cortex; they are already present in patients with\\nearly disease, but they increase in number with disease\\nduration and age, becoming prominent in PMS\\npatients.11,12 Subpial lesions, which are cortical lesions\\nhighly speciﬁc for MS, are characterized by demyelination\\nextending inward from the brain pial surface that may\\ninvolve, especially in PMS, several gyri.\\nMS is a chronic inﬂammatory disease throughout all\\nstages. Thus, even in PMS patients, T- and B-cell central\\nnervous system (CNS) inﬁltration vastly exceeds that seen\\nin controls or in patients with neurodegenerative\\nTABLE 1.

Especially in the pro-\\ngressive stage, inﬂammatory inﬁltrates are mainly compart-\\nmentalized, with a location in the meninges and large\\nperivascular venular spaces,13 in the absence of overt BBB\\nleakage. This compartmentalized in ﬂammation plays a\\nmajor role in driving MS progression. This is invariably\\npresent in patients with active WM SELs,7 whereas active\\ncortical demyelination and neurodegeneration correlate\\nwith the degree of meningeal inﬂammation and the for-\\nmation of folliclelike in ﬂammatory aggregates in the\\nmeninges.14 The extent of diffuse neurodegeneration in\\nthe normal-appearing WM and cortex is also partially\\nassociated with meningeal inﬂammation. In some patients,\\nespecially those with longstanding disease, the lympho-\\ncytic inﬁltrate is similar to that of age-matched controls.\\nIn these patients, no active demyelination at the plaque\\nedges was found, and the extent of acute axonal injury\\nwas similar to that seen in age-matched controls,15 indi-\\ncating that disease progression in late phases may addition-\\nally be driven by age-related neurodegeneration and\\ncomorbidities.\\nAlthough many different mechanisms have been\\npostulated to cause neurodegeneration in the MS brain,\\nthe cascade of microglia activation, oxidative injury, and\\nsubsequent mitochondrial injury appears to play a promi-\\nnent role.1 Because similar mechanisms are also involved\\nin other neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging, they\\nare likely to contribute to disease progression in an addi-\\ntive manner.\\nIn conclusion, histopathology studies have shown\\nthat PMS is characterized by severe WM and GM demye-\\nlination, axonal loss, meningeal inﬂammatory aggregates,\\nand GM involvement and a compartmentalization of\\ninﬂammatory processes. Such pathological abnormalities\\nseem more quantitatively rather than qualitatively different\\nin PMS compared to RRMS, with a dominance of inﬂam-\\nmatory phenomena in the earliest phases and neu-\\nrodegeneration in the progressive forms.\\nAlthough histopathology is the gold standard for\\nunderstanding the processes involved in MS progression,\\nit presents some intrinsic limitations. The major limitation\\nis the lack of a longitudinal assessment, documenting the\\ndynamic evolution of different lesion types in a disease\\ncourse, which spans from early relapsing to late progressive\\nFIGURE 1: The spectrum of brain lesions in a 34-year-old male patient with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis after 10-year\\ndisease duration.

In addition, due to the low number of autopsy\\ncases, information regarding the pathology in patients with\\na normal course of RRMS is limited. Accordingly, further\\nstudies are necessary to better investigate how the different\\npathological substrates occur in the different phases of the\\ndisease.\\nClinical Identiﬁcation of Ongoing\\nProgression\\nClinically, MS progression is identi ﬁed retrospectively,\\nbased on a history of gradual worsening of disability dur-\\ning an observation of months or years (6– 12 months for\\nRRMS, ≥12 months for PPMS patients).3,5\\nThe Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score\\nand its functional system subscores are typically used to\\nmeasure MS-related disability. Step increases in EDSS\\nhelp to identify disability progression, and must be con-\\nﬁrmed after 3 to 6 months to distinguish true progression\\nfrom reversible disability associated with a relapse, or\\nassessment errors.4,5 However, the EDSS has limitations\\n(low reliability, reliance on locomotor functions > 4.0,\\nlimited sensitivity to progression at higher scores). In a\\nrecent study, the best combined criteria for de ﬁning\\nSPMS were an increase of 1 EDSS step when EDSS is\\n≤5.5 or 0.5 step when EDSS is ≥6 in the absence of\\nrelapses, a minimum EDSS score of 4.0 and pyramidal\\nfunctional system score of 2, and conﬁrmed progression\\nover ≥3 months, including conﬁrmation within the lead-\\ning functional system.5\\nThe Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite\\n(MSFC) score comprises quantitative measures of leg\\nfunction/ambulation (Timed 25-Foot Walk [T25FW]),\\narm/hand function (9-Hole Peg Test [9-HPT]), and cog-\\nnition (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test), providing a\\nmore comprehensive neurological assessment. Although\\nMSFC may be in ﬂuenced by learning effects and the\\nmethods used to calculate z scores, a recent meta-analy-\\nsis16 showed that MSFC change can be a sensitive and\\neffective tool to assess the clinical severity and progression\\nof MS disease.\\nTo improve the sensitivity and the accuracy of the\\ndeﬁnition of progression, other composite outcomes have\\nbeen proposed, combining conﬁrmed worsening of at least\\none among EDSS score, ≥20% worsening of T25FW,\\nand ≥ 20% worsening of 9-HPT.\\nTo assess the effects of disability progression on\\npatients’ daily lives, several wearable digital devices (eg,\\naccelerometers, Global Positioning System tracking\\ndevices), able to measure different functions and activities,\\nare under investigation.\\nIt is noteworthy that disease activity, in terms of\\nclinical relapses and MRI activity, can also occur in PMS.\\nThis evidence has guided the recent revision of the pheno-\\ntypic categories of MS proposed by Lublin et al,3 which\\nclassiﬁes PMS in \"active\" or \"inactive\" based on the pres-\\nence of relapses or MRI activity. This classiﬁcation could\\nidentify PMS patients having more inﬂammatory activity,\\nwho are typically younger and with a shorter disease dura-\\ntion, and might show greater beneﬁts from disease-modi-\\nfying treatments currently approved for PMS.2\\nMRI Biomarkers\\nWM Lesions\\nThe number of T2-hyperintense lesions at disease onset\\nand change in T2-hyperintense lesion load within theﬁrst\\nfew years after disease onset help to predict the risk of\\nlong-term disability worsening (Fig 2).17,18 In clinically\\nisolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of MS, lesion topogra-\\nphy at disease onset, particularly when asymptomatic\\nlesions involve the infratentorial regions 19 and spinal\\ncord,20 also predicts disability worsening. By showing that\\nbaseline gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing and spinal cord\\nlesions and new spinal cord lesions over theﬁrst 3 years of\\nthe disease are associated with the development of SPMS\\nand disability worsening after 15 years,20 a recent study\\nemphasizes the value of spinal cord MRI in identifying\\npatients at high risk of disease progression.\\nHistorically, the burden of WM lesions and Gd-\\nenhancing lesions has been reported to be lower in PPMS\\ncompared to RRMS and SPMS. However, more recent\\nevidence did not conﬁrm these ﬁndings.21,22 Similarly to\\nrelapse-onset MS, a proportion of PPMS patients have\\nGd-enhancing lesions early in the disease course that grad-\\nually decline with disease duration,21,22 thus suggesting\\nthat PPMS and relapse-onset MS could share many neuro-\\nimagingﬁndings.\\nMRI has identiﬁed a subgroup of focal WM lesions\\nthat progressively increase in size and hypointensity on T1-\\nweighted images, independently from BBB damage (see\\nFig 2), likely to correspond to the pathologically deﬁned\\nSELs.6,7 Automatic detection of SELs based on conven-\\ntional T1- and T2-weighted sequences has been proposed\\nfor both RRMS and PPMS.23 The identiﬁcation of lesions\\nwith iron-laden rims using susceptibility-based sequences at\\n3 or 7T is another option for detecting SELs,24 which are\\nassociated with a more disabling disease course.24 However,\\nit remains unclear whether these rims should be considered\\na distinct feature of PMS.

A\\nmulticenter longitudinal study (mean follow-up =\\n2.41 years) showed that PMS patients experience faster\\ndeep GM and cortical atrophy compared to healthy con-\\ntrols and RRMS.

Several radiotracers are not disease-speciﬁc, and their\\npathological relevance still needs to be deﬁned. Moreover,\\ndifferently from MRI, PET allows investigation of a single\\npathological mechanism for each acquisition, justifying its\\ncombination with MRI, and it involves the exposure to\\nionizing radiations, which represents a concern, especially\\nto monitor MS patients longitudinally.\\nThalamus\\nThalamic atrophy is highly common in MS, yet is not\\nstrongly related to intrathalamic lesions, and seems to\\nfunction as a“barometer” for WM (network) disconnec-\\ntion throughout the brain. Thalamic atrophy occurs from\\nthe earliest phases of MS,73 with a rate that has been dem-\\nonstrated to be faster in PMS in one study38 but not in\\nothers.74,75\\nIn relapse-onset MS patients followed for 8 years, a\\nmodel including baseline thalamic volume and percentage\\nchange in lesion MTR after 12 months predicted disabil-\\nity worsening.76 In a 5-year study, a model including nor-\\nmal-appearing WM mean diffusivity and thalamic\\nfractional anisotropy predicted EDSS worsening in\\nPPMS.77\\nSample sizes required for using thalamic atrophy in\\nclinical trials have also been calculated.74 However, at pre-\\nsent, the quantiﬁcation of thalamic atrophy and damage is\\nlimited to research studies.\\nFunctional MRI\\nUsing active (cognitive, motor, etc) and resting state func-\\ntional MRI, functional reorganization has been consis-\\ntently demonstrated across the spectrum of MS clinical\\nphenotypes. Analysis of correlations between fMRIﬁnd-\\nings and measures derived from clinical assessment and\\nstructural MRI techniques supports the hypothesis that in\\npatients with PMS, a collapse of functional network com-\\npetencies may be among the factors contributing to clini-\\ncal worsening.78– 80 A 2-year study in RRMS patients\\ndemonstrated that depletion of functional connectivity\\nenhancement, after having reached a maximal level, con-\\ntributes to disability progression.78\\nExpanding the Concept of PMS\\nCognition\\nCognitive dif ﬁculties are often experienced by MS\\npatients, and the most prevalent and severe impairments\\noccur in information processing speed and episodic mem-\\nory. There is a decline over time, but this may be slow\\nand poorly correlated with disease duration.81 Whereas\\n74% of early MS patients were cognitively intact at base-\\nline, after 10 years only 44% were intact.82\\nThere are international recommendations for annual\\ncognitive assessment in MS clinics, but as yet these are\\nnot widely implemented. Moreover, only a small propor-\\ntion of trials have included cognition outcomes,83 possibly\\ndue to the lack of appropriate tools and the challenges of\\nlongitudinal assessment. Several batteries have been rec-\\nommended and validated for MS cognition.84 Whereas\\nthe more lengthy and complex Brief Repeatable Battery–\\nNeuropsychology (45 minutes) and Minimal Assessment\\nof Cognitive Function in Multiple Sclerosis (90 minutes)\\nare appropriate for researchers, a shorter assessment, such\\nas the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multi-\\nple Sclerosis 85 or the assessment only of information\\nprocessing speed using the Symbol Digit Modalities Test\\n(SDMT),86 is more appropriate for clinical use.\\nOne complication in cognition assessment is cogni-\\ntive reserve. Intellectual enrichment seems to offer some\\nprotection of cognitive performance, in the context of any\\ngiven pathology progression.87 A further dilemma is how\\nto accommodate practice effects. Parallel forms of tests\\ncould only mitigate practice effects and need validation to\\ndemonstrate that they are of equal difﬁculty. People learn\\nto do the test, not just the precise stimuli, and even short-\\nterm practice effects have clinically meaningful prognostic\\nimplications.88 Nevertheless, it is possible to determine a\\nstatistically signiﬁcant change; for example, in the SDMT,\\na clinically meaningful change of 4 points is becoming\\naccepted.86\\nPatient-Reported Outcomes\\nPatient-reported outcomes (PROs) refers to the standard-\\nized assessment of symptoms, function, or multi-\\ndimensional constructs such as health-related quality of\\nlife (HRQOL) provided directly by the patient.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Carlini\\\\OneDrive - Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna\\\\Articoli\\\\MS\\\\Annals of Neurology - 2024 - Calabrese - Determinants and Biomarkers of Progression Independent of Relapses in Multiple.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='The Rationale of the Review\\nThe heterogeneous and largely unpredictable clinical\\noutcome of multiple sclerosis (MS) has puzzled physicians\\nfor decades. Most patients (/C2485%) present with a\\nrelapsing– remitting (RR) course, characterized by acute\\nattacks followed by complete or partial recovery, and even-\\ntually experience progressive accumulation of irreversible\\ndisability1 in the later stage of the disease (secondary pro-\\ngressive [SP] MS). While this phenotypic distinction\\nenhances homogeneity in clinical trials and allows standard-\\nized communication among clinicians, emerging evidence\\nsuggests a biological continuum in which pathological mech-\\nanisms underlying relapses and progression coexist from the\\nearly stage of the disease.2– 5 Despite the successful therapeu-\\ntic suppression of relapses and magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI) active inﬂammatory lesions (Fig2A– D), MS patients\\noften report a gradual but progressive worsening of physical\\nand cognitive functions. This discrepancy indicates an ongo-\\ning “smoldering” biological activity, albeit challenging to\\ndetect, which is commonly referred to as progression inde-\\npendent of relapsing activity (PIRA)2 or silent progression,6\\nand is distinct from relapse-associated worsening (RAW).\\nIn the pooled analysis of the OPERA trials, in both\\nthe ocrelizumab and interferon-treated groups, PIRA events\\naccounted for disability accumulation in a substantial pro-\\nportion (>80%) of RRMS patients despite their relatively\\nshort disease duration (mean six years).2 A large pooled\\nclinical trials dataset3 and recent data from a real-world\\nobservational cohort 5 conﬁrmed this ﬁnding. Among\\npatients from the Italian MS registry experiencing disease\\nworsening, PIRA was more commonly reported than RAW\\nsince the second year after the disease onset. Furthermore,\\nits frequency proportionally increased with the disease dura-\\ntion.5 Notably, patients free of ongoing in ﬂammatory\\nattacks can also experience signiﬁcant deterioration of their\\ncognitive function from the earliest disease stages,7,8 which\\naccumulates silently for several years.9 However, PIRA has\\nhistorically referred to progression independent of clinical\\nrelapses but inadequately captures subclinical disease activity\\naccounting for disease worsening. Indeed, the emerging def-\\ninition of PIRA includes new asymptomatic brain and spi-\\nnal cord lesions PIRMA (progression independent of\\nrelapse and MRI activity), thus aligning to outcomes mea-\\nsures used in MRI research and trials.\\nThe effective suppression of acute in ﬂammatory\\nparameters (relapses and active MRI lesions) might falsely\\nindicate disease control while underlying biological mecha-\\nnisms leading to a subtle deterioration remain clinically\\nundetected. Understanding mechanisms and identifying\\nbiomarkers of such silent deterioration remain essential\\nunmet needs.\\nPathological Substrates\\nImmunopathologically, it is plausible to hypothesize that\\nthe smoldering MS activity is characterized by a continu-\\nous interplay between intrathecal (cerebrospinalﬂuid\\n[CSF] and meninges) and parenchymal chronic processes\\nof inﬂammation and neurodegeneration, which associate\\nglial activation and neuro-axonal dysfunction/loss with\\nadditional age-related pathological mechanisms.10– 14\\nA complex interaction among different immuno-\\npathogenic and neurodegenerative processes (Fig1) possi-\\nbly underlines the disease progression and includes: (1)\\nacute blood-brain barrier breakdown/brain and spinal cord\\natrophy; (2) perivascular/meningeal in ﬂammation; (3)\\nacute focal white matter (WM) lesions/ diffuse gray matter\\n(GM) lesions; (4) acute glia priming/chronic microglia\\nactivation; (5) mitochondrial damage/impaired energy pro-\\nduction; (6) loss of trophic support/ remyelination failure.\\nSeveral potential underlying mechanisms for PIRA15\\nhave been suggested in the past decade including the\\nformation of meningeal lymphoid-aggregates with the\\nassociated subpial cortical demyelination and the conse-\\nquent accumulation of neuronal damage and cortical\\natrophy, the accumulation of chronic active lesions (CAL,\\nalso termed slowly expanding, smoldering or mixed active/\\ninactive lesions); and the remyelination failure.

In addi-\\ntion, speciﬁc neuronal subpopulations may be more sus-\\nceptible to MS-related damage. Recent studies have\\nsuggested a selective vulnerability of inhibitory neuronal\\nnetworks with a preferential loss of inhibitory interneu-\\nrons in the MS cortex, potentially altering normal brain\\nnetwork functioning.75\\nSimilarly, the diffuse synaptic loss observed in MS\\nbrains is probably related to lesion-dependent and lesion-\\nindependent mechanisms. Data from animal models and\\npost-mortem MS brains suggest that acute synaptic loss is\\nassociated with in ﬂammation, which resolves and\\nis followed by synaptic re-organization.76– 83 Synapses are\\nprobably targeted by complement factors C1q and C3 and\\nremoved by activated microglia in close contact with neu-\\nrons.77,81– 85 In animal models, in ﬂammatory cytokines\\n(such as TNFα, IL-1, IFNγ) have been shown to induce\\nsynaptic alterations79,80,86 and could contribute to syn-\\naptopathy among MS patients. Beyond structural synaptic\\ndamage, inﬂammation in the CNS can lead to abnormali-\\nties in the ability of synapses to express forms of long-term\\nplasticity, such as long-term potentiation, contributing to\\nbrain network failure and disconnection.\\nLower synaptic density has been reported in GM\\nlesions compared to the normal-appearing\\nGM (NAGM),64,74,76,87 suggesting that focal demyelin-\\nation enhances long-term synaptic loss. However, the syn-\\naptic loss appears to be relatively independent of focal\\ndemyelination76,77,88 and was found to be unrelated to\\nthe extent of the neuroaxonal loss,76,77,88 suggesting the\\ncoexistence of a diffuse primary synaptic pathology, possi-\\nbly driven by the chronic inﬂammation present in the\\nGM and meninges.\\nRole of Chronic Oxidative Injury/Mitochondrial\\nDamage and Energy Deﬁcit\\nThe occurrence of an “energetic crisis” is widely recog-\\nnized as one of the key pathological mechanisms underly-\\ning the dysfunction of the neuro-axonal unit. 89\\nDemyelinated axons require more energy to operate and\\nguarantee conduction, ultimately increasing the metabolic\\ndemand.90 During demyelination, the mitochondria\\nwithin the MS plaques move from the neuronal cell body\\nto the axon, increasing the axonal mitochondrial con-\\ntent.91 Such a homeostatic response cannot fully and per-\\nsistently compensate for the increased axonal energy\\ndemand. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and the\\nfunctional activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain\\ncomplexes I and III, are decreased in the motor cortex of\\nseverely disabled MS patients,92 and multiple deletions of\\nmitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been histologically\\ndemonstrated throughout the GM in progressive MS,\\nwith respiratory-deﬁcient neurons harboring high levels of\\nclonally expanded mtDNA deletions at the single-cell\\nlevel.93 In demyelinated axons predominantly located at\\nthe edge of chronic active lesions, reduced levels of com-\\nplex IV activity have been shown, 94 together with an\\ninverse correlation between complex IV activity and mac-\\nrophage/microglial density, suggesting that soluble prod-\\nucts released by such cells might be responsible for the\\nobserved functional impairment.94,95 Reactive oxygen and\\nnitrogen species (ROS and RNS) deriving from innate\\nimmune cells, when excessively liberated, can trigger mito-\\nchondrial pathology and initiate a process of focal axonal\\nswelling, determining axon fragmentation. 96 Further\\nexperimental evidence of the contribution of mitochon-\\ndrial and energy deﬁcits comes fromﬂuid biomarker stud-\\nies. Patients with progressive MS display increased CSF\\nlevels of mtDNA,97 while CSF lactate levels correlate with\\ndisease-worsening and axonal damage markers, such as\\nneuroﬁlament light protein.98 It is worth noting that not\\nonly a condition of“virtual” hypoxia due to an increased\\nenergy demand but also the presence of“true” tissue hyp-\\noxia (i.e., oxygen de ﬁciency) has been hypothesized to\\noccur in MS. 89 Taken together, evidence suggests the\\nvicious “hypoxia-inﬂammation” cycle as a potential tar-\\nget99 for neuroprotective strategies aiming at restoring the\\nneuronal mitochondrial activity and ultimately preventing\\nthe disease progression.100\\nAlterations in Normal Appearing White and\\nGrey Matter\\nThe normal-appearing tissue of the WM (NAWM) and\\nGM is affected by axonal injury (both intrinsic and extrin-\\nsic to the tissues), gliosis, widespread diffuse microglial\\nactivation, and disrupted myelin, which displays altered\\nbiochemical and biophysical qualities. 101– 105 Normal\\ncomposition of mature myelin is essential for oligodendro-\\ncyte and axonal health, myelin ensheathment, and place-\\nment and organization of the nodes of Ranvier. 106\\nWidespread changes at the node of Ranvier, theﬂanking\\nparanodal assembly, and the juxtaparanode, are seen near\\nand far from the MS lesion. 107– 109 Notably, activated\\nmicroglia are associated with nodal disruption, where\\nattenuating microglial activation with minocycline reduces\\nnodal and paranodal damage and blocking glutamate,\\nwhich is excessively generated by activated microglia, abro-\\ngates this change.107– 109 These changes in the NAWM\\nand NAGM could contribute to clinical worsening inde-\\npendent of new inﬂammatory attacks.90,96\\n6 Volume 96, No. 1\\nANNALS of Neurology\\n 15318249, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26913 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [15/08/2024].

Many pro-inﬂammatory mechanisms\\nhave been suggested to be involved in active demyelin-\\nation and neurodegeneration. Still, the production of reac-\\ntive oxygen species appears particularly important. In\\ncontrast to rodent models, NADPH oxidase (Nox2)\\nexpression in human microglia and macrophages is promi-\\nnent, while the iNOS expression is sparse. This is associ-\\nated with a profound acute oxidative injury in neurons\\nand glia in active lesions.149 In the earliest descriptions of\\nMS pathology in the late 19th century, it was already\\nnoted that active demyelination and neurodegeneration in\\nMS lesions are closely associated with activated microglia\\nand macrophages. A subset of microglia and macrophages\\nat the edge of chronic active lesions contain iron and can\\nbe visualized in vivo with MRI.20 Such an iron rim is a\\nmarker for the slow expansion of lesions, relevant for silent\\nor overt disease progression in MS.28\\nNew markers became available during the past few\\nyears, allowing us to differentiate between activated\\nmicroglia and recruited myeloid cells within the lesions.\\nThey suggest most phagocytes in active MS lesions are\\nderived from the microglia pool.24\\nRecent spatial transcriptomics or proteomics studies\\nconﬁrmed the ﬁndings, which had been elucidated before\\nwith conventional methodology. 23,150,151 They provide\\nevidence of a profound heterogeneity of microglia and\\nmacrophage phenotypes, with different compositions in\\nlesions based on variable contributions of active demyelin-\\nation, inactive lesions or remyelination. Whether these\\ndifferent cell phenotypes reﬂect genuine cellular subpopu-\\nlations or the transition between naïve, pro-inﬂammatory\\nand anti-inﬂammatory cells is a question that remains\\nunresolved. Meningeal inﬂammation in progressive MS\\npatients was recently found to induce phenotypic changes\\nin cortical microglia that are differentially associated with\\nneurodegeneration.82\\nFocus on the Role of Complement. Complement is a key\\ncomponent of the innate immune system.

Over the past decade, an increasing clinical\\ninterest has been devoted to the detection of CAL as they\\nare associated with higher disease severity and brain and\\nspinal cord atrophy, thus representing a negative prognos-\\ntic indicator for clinical worsening and disease progres-\\nsion.31,162– 164\\nA subset of CAL can now be visualized using\\nsusceptibility-sensitive MRI sequences, that is, T2* and\\nphase contrast, R2* (Fig 2K2,K3) or quantitative suscepti-\\nbility mapping (QSM), as non-enhancing lesions with a\\nparamagnetic rim (termed “paramagnetic rim lesions” or\\nPRL).

SEL are identiﬁed by applying\\nJacobian determinant algorithms (non-linear deformation)\\nto registered T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR images on at\\nleast three time-points. The computed radial and linear\\nlesion expansion has been interpreted as lesion expansion.\\nNo histopathological validation has been provided for SEL\\nquantiﬁed by the Jacobian determinant algorithm, and\\npathological processes other than inﬂammatory demyelin-\\nation might explain the imaging ﬁnding (i.e., Wallerian\\nneurodegeneration, and microvascular comorbidities). SEL\\nhave been detected in both relapsing and progressive MS\\npatients, and they were shown to predict disability and\\nprogression at 7 and 9 years of follow-up.173– 175 Modest\\neffects on SEL were seen in MS patients treated by current\\ndisease-modifying therapies.173,176– 178\\nThe limited overlap between PRL and SEL is a mat-\\nter of current debate; in a recent study,179 PRL satisfying\\nthe mathematical deﬁnition of SEL (39% of all PRL)\\nshowed microstructural tissue degeneration tissue over\\n72 weeks. A possible explanation for the discrepancy\\nbetween the 2 biomarkers is that a subset of SEL has low\\niron content and, therefore, is not visible as PRL. In addi-\\ntion, recent imaging studies validated that not all CALs\\ncorrespond to SELs or PRLs. Still, when PRLs are co-\\nlocalized with SELs, they show expansion and worsening\\nmicrostructural damage over time,179 supporting a key\\nrole of smoldering in ﬂammation in accumulating neu-\\nrodegeneration and disease progression.179\\nBrain and Grey Matter Atrophy\\nMRI changes in brain volume have proven clinical rele-\\nvance in MS (Fig 2H1– H10) as a marker of irreversible\\ntissue loss (i.e., brain atrophy). 180 Several studies have\\nconsistently shown that brain atrophy rates are higher in\\npatients with MS than in healthy subjects since the earliest\\ndisease stage. Atrophy appears diffuse in the MS brain and\\nspinal cord, particularly in subcortical and cortical regions,\\npossibly reﬂecting the early neuroaxonal involvement.181\\nCompared with clinically stable patients, patients\\nwith PIRA had an increased rate of brain volume loss,\\nmainly driven by cerebral GM loss (Fig 2H1– H10).\\nMoreover, MS patients with PIRA had similar brain\\natrophy6 and cortical thinning and deep GM volume loss\\nrates182 to those patients experiencing disability accumula-\\ntion due to relapses. Interestingly, these studies indepen-\\ndently suggested that atrophy rates could be partially\\ndissociated from relapse activity and likely to reﬂect mech-\\nanisms leading to the silent progression of MS.\\nComplementary to the brain atrophy assessment, the\\n‘brain-age’ paradigm183 utilizes the relationship between\\ndisease and healthy brain structural ageing to understand\\nthe impact of diseases. The difference between an\\nindividual’s chronological age and the brain-predicted age\\n(brain-PAD or brain age gap) has been proposed as an\\nage-adjusted index of structural brain health. Using 3D\\nT1-weighted MRI and machine learning algorithms, the\\nbrain-age paradigm offers the advantage of setting a sub-\\nject’s state in the context of a normal population with an\\neasily interpreted ﬁgure. MS has a pronounced effect on\\nthe brain-PAD metric, indicative of poor structural brain\\nhealth. Furthermore, measures of brain-predicted age\\nincrease more rapidly than usual chronological ageing in\\nboth RR and progressive MS, implying that the brain-age\\napproach is sensitive to accelerations in MS brain atro-\\nphy.184 Recently, brain age was associated with the wors-\\nening of the Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT)\\nperformance.185\\nFocal Cortical Demyelination\\nSubstantial immunopathological (Fig 2F1) and imaging\\n(Fig 2F2) evidence conﬁrmed that focal demyelination\\noccurs in MS since the early phases of the disease within\\nboth the cortical and deep GM, accumulates over time\\nand provides a good clinical correlate in terms of disability\\naccumulation.10,36,54,101,186\\nCLs are at least partly independent of WM acute\\ndemyelination88,187 and usually do not show contrast\\nenhancement.36 The focal cortical damage is associated\\nwith a progression of physical and cognitive disability\\nindependently of relapse186,188– 190 and its occurrence at\\nclinical onset predicts a greater risk of disability progres-\\nsion.186,190– 192\\nA 30-year longitudinal study indicated the focal cor-\\ntical demyelination as 1 of the primary substrates of dis-\\nease progression, with CLs’ burden alone explaining 43%\\nof the variance of the expanded disability status scale\\n(EDSS).89 On the contrary, a study on“benign MS” rev-\\nealed that after 15 years of the disease, those patients who\\nstill demonstrated scarce disability progression and cogni-\\ntive preservation showed a remarkably lower CLs number\\ncompared to early RRMS.192 In line with these data, the\\nlesions of deep GM, especially the thalamic lesions, have\\nbeen associated with disability progression being greater in\\nprogressive MS compared to RRMS.193\\nJuly 2024 9\\nCalabrese et al: PIRA in Multiple Sclerosis\\n 15318249, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26913 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [15/08/2024].

The prognostic relevance of isolated spinal\\ncord lesions (SCL) for developing a progressive disease\\ncourse has been shown by studying extreme disease cases.\\nPatients with solitary demyelinating lesions involving the\\nspinal cord or cervical-medullary/brainstem regions devel-\\noped an early progressive disease course.195 In addition, in\\nsubjects with radiological isolated syndrome (RIS), SCL\\nincreased the risk of evolving to PPMS rather than\\nRRMS.196 From the analysis of conventional MRI\\nsequences, a few imaging features have been identiﬁed that\\ncan contribute to the early identiﬁcation of those patients\\nwho will develop a progressive MS course or accumulate\\nmore severe disability. These include the presence of dif-\\nfuse signal hyperintensities on proton-density weighted\\nsequences (i.e., abnormal areas of intermediate signal\\nintensity between that of focal lesions and normal-\\nappearing spinal cord, lacking a well-demarcated border\\nfrom the adjacent normal-appearing cord)197,198 and the\\ninvolvement of cord central GM (Fig2J1– J3).199– 201 Har-\\nboring spinal cord lesions is an important prognostic fac-\\ntor in identifying CIS patients with a shorter time to\\nconversion to MS,202 more severe accumulation of clinical\\ndisability203 and evolution to SPMS after 15 years of\\nfollow-up.204 Using quantitative MRI techniques, such as\\nmagnetisation transfer MRI,205 a gradient of microstruc-\\ntural damage in the outer surface of the cord, which might\\nreﬂect the presence of subpial demyelination, was found\\nin patients with MS and was more severe among those\\nwith a progressive phenotype. A recent 7 T study206\\nfound that SCL have a greater propensity to occur closer\\nto the central canal and subpial CSF interfaces, with a dif-\\nferent behavior according to MS clinical phenotype (more\\ninvolvement of central canal in progressive MS and of the\\nouter subpial surface in RRMS).\\nIn addition to focal demyelinating lesions, irrevers-\\nible tissue loss (i.e., atrophy) in the spinal cord can be seen\\namong MS patients. Spinal cord atrophy (Fig 2I1– I3)\\noccurs in all MS clinical phenotypes, is more pronounced\\nand diffuse in progressive rather than relapsing MS\\npatients, is associated with concurrent clinical disability\\nand tends to progress over time.207,208 While a signiﬁcant\\nrelationship is present between cord atrophy and accumu-\\nlating disability in the short-term,209– 211 it disappears at\\nlonger clinical follow-up (more than 10 years), suggesting\\nthat spinal cord atrophy may be critical for clinical deteri-\\noration in theﬁrst years of the disease. However, it might\\nsubsequently reach a ceiling effect.212– 214 A recent study\\nwith 12 years of follow-up found that RRMS patients\\nwho developed SPMS had faster cord atrophy rates\\n(/C02.19% per year) at least 4 years before conversion com-\\npared to those patients who remained RRMS (/C00.88%\\nper year).214 A faster spinal cord atrophy rate was associ-\\nated with a shorter time to silent progression and SPMS\\nconversion, challenging the traditional dichotomy of an\\nRRMS and subsequent SPMS phenotype.\\nNew Promising Imaging Biomarkers to Identify\\nthe Disease Progression\\nThe Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density\\nImaging. The neurite orientation dispersion and density\\nimaging (NODDI) is a diffusion-weighted multi-shell\\nMRI model that provides speci ﬁc measures of tissue\\nmicrostructure (Fig 2E2). These include the intracellular\\nvolume fraction (ICV_f)/neurite density index (NDI),\\nreﬂecting neurite density, and orientation dispersion index\\n(ODI), quantifying neurite orientation variability and tis-\\nsue coherence and complexity.215 In a recent study, PRL\\nshowed decreased myelin water fraction but also NDI\\nrelative to lesions without a rim,216 conﬁrming the patho-\\nlogical evidence of ongoing demyelination and axonal\\ndamage in these lesions.34,217 Signiﬁcantly lower ICV_f/NDI\\nin the NAWM218,219 and cortex,216,218– 220 and ODI in the\\ncortex219,220 were found in progressive compared to RRMS\\npatients, and they correlated with more severe clinical dis-\\nability, thus conﬁrming in vivo that a clinically relevant\\nprogressive neurite loss and a simpliﬁcation of dendritic\\narborization may contribute to the disease severity.219,220\\nConstrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) is\\nanother diffusion-weighted multi-shell MRI model that\\nallows to deﬁne the ﬁber-bundle cross-section area, a\\nmarker of axonal shrinkage/loss across a plane perpendicu-\\nlar to the ﬁber-bundle axis that may better quantify the\\ndegeneration of the WM ﬁber-bundles.221,222 A signiﬁ-\\ncant reduction ofﬁber-bundle cross-section area, gradually\\nworsening over 1 year and reﬂecting more severe WM\\ntract volume loss, has been found in progressive compared\\nto RRMS patients,223,224 mainly involving clinically rele-\\nvant WM tracts, including the cerebellar peduncles, the\\ncortico-spinal tract, the cingulum and the corpus\\n10 Volume 96, No. 1\\nANNALS of Neurology\\n 15318249, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26913 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [15/08/2024].

Moreover, a lower ﬁber-bundle cross-section\\narea in the NAWM and in the sensorimotor WM tracts\\nwas found to be signiﬁcantly correlated with more severe\\nclinical disability 223 and with gait and motor control\\nimpairment, respectively.225\\nSoma and neurite density imaging (SANDI) is\\nanother model that may estimate not only MRI signal\\nfractions attributed to neurites (fneurite), but also of bodies\\nof any CNS cell (fsoma).226 Two recent studies showed\\nthat, compared to HC, MS patients were characterized by\\nsigniﬁcantly lower fneurite both in the NAWM and GM\\nand lower fsoma in ther GM.227,228 These microstructural\\nabnormalities were signiﬁcantly more severe in progressive\\nMS patients,227 and they were associated with a more severe\\nclinical disability and structural brain damage.227,228\\nNonetheless, the feasibility of these advanced\\ndiffusion-weighted multi-shell MRI model in the clinical\\nsetting is limited. Longitudinal studies are still needed to\\nfurther explore the correlation between their derived mea-\\nsure changes and MS progression.\\nLeptomeningeal Enhancement. Leptomeningeal enhance-\\nment (LME, (Fig2E2), Fig 2G1– G3), typically visualized\\non delayed post-contrast FLAIR MRI, has been recently\\nexplored as a biomarker for blood-meningeal barrier open-\\ning and meningeal inﬂammation in MS.10,229\\nLME detection on post-contrast 7 T FLAIR is more\\nprevalent than on 3 T FLAIR, occurs at frequencies closer\\nto histopathologic data and allows the investigation of the\\nrelationship between meningeal inﬂammation and cortical\\npathology.230\\nTwo patterns of LME have been described:“nodular”,\\nwith discrete, spherical nodules at the pial surface or\\nsubarachnoid space, and“spread/ﬁll” with the appearance\\nof contrast spread through the local subarachnoid\\nspace.230 In a recent meta-analysis including 1,605 MS\\npatients, the proportion of patients with LME was higher\\nin progressive than in the relapsing MS group (39.8%\\nvs. 53.4%).231 LME is associated with a more severe MS\\ncourse and disease progression,230,232– 235 with the extent\\nof cortical, 234 thalamic,234 and hippocampal 236 lesions\\nand with the rate of brain and cortical atro-\\nphy.230,232,233,236 However, LME is not speciﬁc to MS, as\\nit has also been described in aged healthy con-\\ntrols230,237,238 as well as in patients with other inﬂamma-\\ntory and infective neurologic conditions.231,237,239– 241\\nPositron Emission Tomography. Using radiotracers binding\\nto the TSPO, a mitochondrial protein upregulated in acti-\\nvated microglial/macrophage and astrocytes activation, sev-\\neral PET studies have consistently demonstrated that\\nincreased glial activation could be detected not only in\\nactive WM lesions but also, to a lesser extent, in CLs, and\\na subset of chronic WM lesions (possibly CAL).32,242– 249\\nThe number and volume of lesions with positive PET\\nTSPO uptake were higher in progressive than in RRMS\\npatients and correlated with the development of clinical\\ndisability242 and with WM lesions accumulation. Using\\n18F-DPA7142, a ﬂuorinated second-generation TSPO\\nradioligand, more than half of WM lesions (53%) showed\\na homogeneously active core, and their number was the\\nbest predictor of cortical atrophy and disability progression\\nover 2 years.250\\nTSPO PET also revealed a more diffuse brain\\ninﬂammatory component in the NAWM, thalamus and\\ncortex.242– 249,251,252 Consistently with pathological\\nﬁndings,88 such widespread glial-microglial activation was\\nhigher in patients with a more severe disability and a pro-\\ngressive disease course, correlated with structural brain\\ndamage,242– 249 and predicted disability progression up to\\n4 years later.243\\nFluid Biomarkers\\nPotential Biomarkers of Neuroaxonal\\nDegeneration\\nNeuroﬁlaments are polymeric proteins constituting micro-\\ntubules and microﬁlaments in the neuronal cytoskeleton,\\nproviding structural support for axons.

The current\\nclassiﬁcation system is based on separate clinical stages,\\nincluding relapsing– remitting (RR), secondary progressive\\n(SP), and primary progressive (PP) courses 1 and places\\nemphasis on the white matter (WM) focal inﬂammation,\\nwhich represents the biological substrate for clinical\\nrelapses and new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\\nlesions and has been the ubiquitous target of disease-\\nmodifying treatments (DMTs).\\nIn a large proportion of people with MS (pwMS),\\nwe succeed at therapeutically inducing disease remission\\nwith no evidence of inﬂammatory disease activity (NEIDA).\\nHowever, despite stable inﬂammatory parameters, pwMS\\noften experience disability worsening, highlighting a dissocia-\\ntion between focal inﬂammatory mechanisms and those\\naccounting for the accumulation of disability in a more\\nindolent fashion, and arguing against the current phenotypic\\ndistinction of separate relapsing and progressive stages.\\nRecent studies demonstrated that, in addition to\\nrelapse-associated worsening (RAW), progression independent\\nof relapse activity (PIRA) occurs from the early RR phase,2,3\\nindicating that MS is underpinned by a biological contin-\\nuum with different pathological mechanisms tightly inter-\\nmingled since the earliest stages of the disease.4 However,\\nsubtle accumulation of symptoms and signs is often not\\ncaptured by the deﬁnition of PIRA, which is predomi-\\nnantly based on clinical scales of motor performance, but it\\nis largely insensitive to worsening in other clinical domains.\\nPathology, neuroimaging, and clinical insights support\\na paradigm shift in our understanding of the biological mech-\\nanisms within the CNS that contribute to MS worsening.4,5\\nThe gradual accumulation of physical and cognitive disability\\nis driven by smouldering pathological processes via biological\\nsubstrates, which are differentfrom those of acute focal dam-\\nage and remain an important unmet therapeutic target.6\\nTo date, there is no uniform deﬁnition of smouldering\\ndisease in MS, nor of its clinical manifestations and patho-\\nlogical substrates. In this context, we previously reviewed\\nthe biological perspective of pathological drivers within the\\nCNS responsible for smouldering disease in MS.6 Here, we\\nset out to deﬁne clinical and radiological manifestations of\\nsmouldering processes, its underlying biology and bio-\\nmarkers. We provide consensus statements and recommen-\\ndations to integrate the concept of smouldering disease in\\nMS into clinical practice, to discuss its implications for clini-\\ncal trial design and regulatory pathways, and to promote\\nresearch activities to understand better its pathological\\nmechanisms.\\nMethods\\nAn international panel of 15 MS experts from 8 countries\\nacross Europe, the United States, and Canada convened\\nin June 2021 to develop a consensus on smouldering\\ndisease in MS. This panel was selected based on clinical\\nexperience, scienti ﬁc background and expertise, and\\ngeographical representation. The panel met several times\\nto discuss various aspects of smouldering disease. First, it\\nwas debated and eventually agreed, which categories had\\nto be addressed. This led to the identiﬁcation of key\\ndomains in line with panelists ’ expertise, which were\\nselected as subjects for subsequent debates and included:\\ndeﬁnitions, pathological drivers, the role of aging, clinical\\nand paraclinical manifestations, implications for routine\\nclinical practice, clinical trial design, and regulatory path-\\nways. Second, for each category, a leading expert was\\nselected to coordinate the effort of a subgroup of panelists\\nresponsible for developing statements related to their\\nrespective topic. Finally, the whole panel of experts\\ndebated and reached agreement on proposed statements\\ncovering each domain. The Delphi method was used to\\nanonymously establish the level of agreement on the\\n5-point Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, neither agree\\nnor disagree, disagree and strongly disagree) for each\\nstatement, and a consensus was de ﬁned as ≥75% who\\nstrongly agree or agree to each statement. In addition,\\nwhen voting, experts were given the opportunity to\\nprovide anonymous comments on how statements could\\nbe potentially modiﬁed and improved. The surveys were\\nfacilitated independently by a medical consultant using\\nthe Welphi online survey platform with 100% involve-\\nment of all 15 panelists at every stage of the review.\\nModiﬁcations to statements were made over a maximum\\nof 3 rounds. A total of 41 statements were proposed, with\\n29 ﬁnally reaching consensus ( ≥75% of agreement),\\nwhereas 12 statements were discarded. Among the rejected\\nstatements, some did not reach the minimum required\\nthreshold of 75% level of agreement, whereas others\\nbecause of partial overlapping wording were merged and\\nthen re-surveyed again to check the level of agreement\\namong panelists.

However, she\\nhas complained of “feeling worse,” particularly over the\\nlast 18 months. Although her walking is not impaired, she\\nhas noticed reduced tolerance toexercise, for example, after\\nrunning 2km, she would limp in her right leg (previously\\naffected by a relapse with complete recovery). In addition,\\nshe was more easily fatigued and needed to stop walking after\\n/C2445 minutes. Overall, she felt cognitively slower and\\nreported “brain fog,” with difﬁculties performing complex\\ntasks at work. However, the lack of radiological progression\\non yearly MRIs and the absence of new pathological signs\\non examination implied“stable” disease, and her neurologist\\nreassured her that her therapy was working.\\nThe clinical vignette highlights the limitations of the\\ncurrent phenotypic classiﬁcation of MS.1 Given her low\\nlevel of disability, most physicians would consider such a\\nperson as being in the RR phase and her recent worsening\\nwould not fulﬁl clinical criteria for progressive disease.1\\nEven the current deﬁnition of PIRA8 may not capture her\\nsubtle worsening of symptoms and signs. Her gradual and\\nslow decline, manifesting despite the successful therapeutic\\nsuppression of focal inﬂammatory activity and lack of\\nquantiﬁable clinical changes using currently available met-\\nrics, indicates ongoing pathological processes in the CNS,\\nwhich could be referred to as “smouldering-associated\\nworsening” (SAW) (Table1).\\nClinical Manifestations of Smouldering\\nDisease in MS\\nAs illustrated in the clinical vignette, pwMS often experi-\\nence more than we can currently assess with conventional\\nclinical outcome measures, such as the EDSS7 or the Mul-\\ntiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC).9 Our cur-\\nrent model of managing MS is anchored on crude\\nestimates of physical disability (ambulation and pyramidal\\nfunction) and is overly reliant on identifying relapses and\\nnew MRI lesions as the principal markers of disease activ-\\nity. With longer disease duration and with older age, the\\nfrequency of relapses and ensuing RAW, decreases, 10\\nwhereas the probability of experiencing progressive symptoms\\nincreases.11 However, throughout the natural history of MS,\\nand even in its earliest RR phase, acute attacks are accompa-\\nnied by an underlying subtle progressive course,\\nencompassing a wide range of physical and cognitive\\nsymptoms,11 which can remain clinically undetected for years,\\ncautioning against mistakenly interpreting the lack of acute\\nfocal inﬂammation as a marker of disease stability (Fig1).\\nIn the pooled analysis of the OPERA trials, among\\npeople with RRMS early in the disease course (mean dis-\\nease duration of 6 years), most of the disability\\naccumulation occurred as a result of PIRA.8 Similarly, in\\nthe Italian MS registry, from the second year of onset of\\nthe RR phase, PIRA events were more commonly reported\\nthan RAW.12 In the Barcelona RRMS cohort, 66% of\\nconﬁrmed disability accumulation episodes were unrelated\\nto relapses.2 Furthermore, in a large cohort of people with\\nRRMS from pooled randomized clinical trials, it was\\nshown that up to 50% of events leading to disability accu-\\nmulation were unrelated to overt relapses.3\\nThe deﬁnition of PIRA relies on EDSS7,8 or EDSS-\\nPlus13 increase and it is, therefore, mainly related to motor\\nimpairment. Moreover, SAW is a broader umbrella con-\\ncept, which encompasses PIRA, but also includes a wide\\nrange of gradually worsening symptoms independent of\\nrelapses that remain undetectable on standard assessments\\nespecially in early disease stages, including subtle motor\\nimpairment, cognitive slowing, fatigue, neuropathic\\npain, bowel/bladder, and sexual dysfunction (Table 1\\nand Fig 2). Cognitive impairment can be observed during\\nthe prodrome of MS14 and in a signiﬁcant proportion of\\npeople with radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS),15 or at\\nthe onset of the RR phase.16 The relentless accumulation\\nof fatigue,17,18 bladder/bowel and sexual dysfunction, 19\\nand depression20 throughout the evolution of MS can lead\\nto functional worsening unrelated to clinical or subclinical\\nrelapses. In addition, early in the disease course,\\namong subjects with no walking impairment, transient\\nexercise-induced neurological de ﬁcit (eg, foot drop) or\\nearly fatigability are commonly reported.21 Although this\\nmight initially be a reversible phenomenon, over time it\\ncan become more prominent and more easily triggered by\\nexertion as a result of subtle progressive disease deterioration.\\nFunctional network compensation22 may explain the difﬁ-\\nculty of detecting early deterioration, which may become evi-\\ndent through neurological stress tests. Progressive symptoms\\nmight also emerge with challenging tasks, requiring the\\nsimultaneous activation of several networks.23\\nPathological Drivers of Smouldering\\nDisease in MS\\nThe combination of widespread inﬂammatory and degenera-\\ntive injury, including anterograde and retrograde axonal\\ndegeneration, coupled with the failure of compensatory\\nmechanisms, such as remyelination and neural plasticity, is\\nbelieved to result in SAW.4 Although our understanding of\\nsmouldering disease in MS is still incomplete, mounting evi-\\ndence supports a central role for CNS-intrinsic biological\\nprocesses, even early in the course of MS, which are consid-\\nered distinct from mechanisms underlying relapses and the\\noccurrence of WM focal demyelination. 24– 28 Recent\\ngenome-wide association studies shed light on the genetic\\n3\\nScalfari et al: International Consensus on Smouldering MS\\n 15318249, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27034 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [14/08/2024].

Smouldering disease in MS may promote\\npremature biological aging of the CNS, whereas age-\\ndriven biological changes may also enhance the effect of\\nsmouldering mechanisms, eventually resulting in acceler-\\nated aging of the brain.49,50\\nThe exhaustion of compensatory mechanisms51 and\\nthe age-related decrease in CNS remyelination efﬁciency52\\ncan explain to some extent the gradual occurrence of\\nsymptoms related to smouldering disease with older age\\n(Table 2). Furthermore, the presence of shortened telo-\\nmeres, as a result of aging, correlates with greater\\ndisability,53 and accelerated biological aging in MS can\\nlead to epigenetic changes and cellular senescence, contrib-\\nuting to disease progression.54 In MS brains, glial cells\\nhave been shown to age signi ﬁcantly faster than\\ncontrols.55 In addition, although this has not been dem-\\nonstrated in MS as yet, astrocytes with aging are known\\nto switch to a proinﬂammatory phenotype,56 which might\\ncontribute to the loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes,32\\nwhereas age-related myelin fragmentation can induce\\nmicroglial senescence and dysfunction, 57 potentially\\nimpairing the clearance of myelin debris, leading to\\ndecreased remyelination.58 Finally, with growing older,\\nthe increased occurrence of vascular comorbidities59 can\\nnegatively impact on brain reserve,51 further enhancing\\nsmouldering pathological processes.\\nBecause the brain ages faster in MS, brain-predicted\\nage difference could be a potential imaging surrogate\\nmarker of brain health to monitor smouldering disease\\nin MS.50 Although it may not always be possible to disen-\\ntangle clinical changes related to smouldering disease from\\nwhat it is expected to be related to physiological aging and\\ncomorbidity, future efforts should be focused on the\\nimplementation of outcome measures that take into account\\nage-related decline in neurological functioning to reﬁne the\\nassessment of clinically relevant disease worsening.60\\nCSF/Serological Biomarkers of Smouldering\\nDisease in MS\\nSeveral CSF and blood biomarkers have been proposed\\npotentially to reﬂect the pathophysiology of smouldering\\ndisease in MS, which may be clinically useful for identify-\\ning and monitoring SAW (Table3).

In addition,\\nintrathecal immunoglobulin production and several\\nchemokines have the potential to reﬂect other smoulder-\\ning pathological processes. The measurement of these bio-\\nmarkers is not currently implemented in routine clinical\\npractice, warranting further studies to establish their\\npotential role as markers of smouldering activity.\\nImaging Biomarkers of Smouldering\\nDisease in MS\\nClinicians rely primarily on the radiological detection of\\nnew focal inﬂammatory lesions as a marker of therapeutic\\nresponse. However, it is not uncommon to see individuals\\nwho continue to worsen in the absence of new focal\\nlesions, indicating a disconnection between clinical disease\\nseverity and radiological inﬂammatory lesions load, 78\\nwhich warrants the identiﬁcation of alternative markers\\nthat more comprehensively capture SAW. Slowly expan-\\nding lesions (SELs), PRLs, positron emission tomography\\n(PET) using radioligands speciﬁc for microglia, and imag-\\ning measures of cortical damage have demonstrated\\nclinical relevance for pathological substrates underpinning\\nsmouldering disease in MS (Table3).\\nSlowly Expanding Lesions\\nMRI deﬁned SELs show continuous concentric expansion\\nover time79,80 and may be a biomarker of CALs, one of\\nthe potential pathological substrates of SAW. SELs can be\\ndetected with conventional MRI sequences. By using\\nMRI measures sensitive to myelin content and microstruc-\\ntural tissue integrity (magnetization-transfer imaging, mye-\\nlin water imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and\\nquantitative T1 signal change), it has been demonstrated\\nthat MRI deﬁned SELs are distinguished by greater tissue\\ndestruction compared to non-SEL T2 lesions. 81 The\\nreported occurrence of SELs varies substantially across\\nstudies, but a high proportion (60– 90%) of pwMS has at\\nleast 1 SEL, and a variable proportion (up to 46%) of all\\nT2 lesions can be identiﬁed as MRI deﬁned SELs.82– 84\\nThe variability observed among studies may be attributed\\nto different populations and methods used to identify the\\nslow expansion of lesions. A larger number and/or a\\nhigher proportion of T2-lesions that are MRI deﬁned\\nSELs distinguish patients exhibiting a progressive course,\\ncompared to patients experiencing relapsing disease.82 In\\naddition, the presence of MRI de ﬁned SELs has been\\nassociated with a higher risk of disability progression.82,85\\nOverall, much remains to be clariﬁed about SELs, includ-\\ning optimal detection methodology, the time frame in\\nwhich they should be measured, and how best to use and\\ninterpret their presence and change in clinical trials\\nand clinical settings. Above all, the pathological processes\\nunderlying MRI deﬁned SELs remains to be fully\\nestablished. An important caveat is that MRI deﬁned SELs\\ndo not necessarily correspond to pathologically de ﬁned\\nSELs, which may explain the substantial lack of overlap\\nbetween SELs and PRLs.

Ongoing\\nwork for standardizing TSPO-PET analysis pipelines and\\nfor developing novel ligands able to more speciﬁcally dif-\\nferentiate activated microglia with different functional\\nproperties100 may facilitate the use of PET imaging in the\\nfuture as an outcome measure in clinical trial assessing\\ntreatments targeting smouldering MS pathology.\\nCortical Pathology Measures\\nThe extent of focal demyelination within both the cortical\\nand deep grey matter (GM) strongly correlates with the\\nrate of disease progression and its underlying mechanisms\\nare believed to be unrelated to WM demyelin-\\nation.28,37,101 Cortical lesions (CLs) can be detected from\\nthe early phases of MS,102 and its progressive accumula-\\ntion over time is associated with a higher risk of conver-\\nting to SPMS101,103 and of accumulating severe disability\\nin the long term.104 Moreover, long-term data suggest that\\nCLs may be one of the neuropathological substrates of\\ncognitive impairment.105\\nWith the use of neurite orientation dispersion and\\ndensity imaging (NODDI), among others, it has been\\ndemonstrated that, beyond focal injury, there are diffuse\\nmicrostructural abnormalities in the normal-appearing\\ncortical and deep GM, including cortical neurite loss, sim-\\npliﬁcation of cortical dendritic arborizations and\\ncytoarchitectural complexity, suggestive of neu-\\nrodegeneration.106 Signiﬁcantly more pronounced neurite\\nloss was found in the GM of individuals with progressive\\ndisease, compared to RR groups,107 and in the WM and\\nspinal cord of pwMS, compared to healthy controls,108\\nhighlighting the potential role of NODDI for monitoring\\npathological processes accounting for disability accumula-\\ntion independent of focal inﬂammatory activity.\\nIn addition, diffuse GM atrophy, including measures\\nof cortical atrophy, has been shown to occur from the\\n10 Volume 00, No. 0\\nANNALS of Neurology\\n 15318249, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27034 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [14/08/2024].

Although atro-\\nphy measures mirror the end result of various\\npathobiological processes resulting in tissue destruction\\nand, therefore, are not speciﬁc to only smouldering disease\\nprocesses, they can certainly be useful markers of patho-\\nlogical damage related to SAW. However, important tech-\\nnical limitations persist for the assessment of GM\\npathology radiological markers (CL and atrophy). Most\\nCLs remain undetected by 1.5/3.0T MRI,112 whereas 7T\\nMRI can visualize only 52% more CLs than the best-\\nperforming 3T MRIs.113 Imaging protocols, including\\nnon-conventional sequences, such as 3 dimensional (3D)\\n-DIR, 3D-phase-sensitive inversion-recovery, magnetiza-\\ntion prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE), and\\nMP2RAGE have substantially improved the assessment of\\nCLs in vivo even in a 3T MRI scanner,114– 116 and there-\\nfore, could be used in future clinical trials. Further efforts\\nwill have to focus on additional imaging measures, as out-\\nlined above, that are more speciﬁcally correlated to biolog-\\nical mechanisms underlying SAW, and together with\\natrophy measures can shed more light on the extent of\\nmicrostructural tissue damage driving smouldering dis-\\nease in MS.\\nClinical Markers of Smouldering\\nDisease in MS\\nRoutinely used clinical and paraclinical tools are not ade-\\nquately sensitive to unmask relapse-free clinical worsening,\\nespecially early in the disease course, and the lack of surro-\\ngate markers or universally accepted deﬁnition for contin-\\nuous disability worsening makes this challenging to\\nmonitor even by the most experienced physicians. The\\nEDSS score is widely used as an outcome measure of neu-\\nrological impairment and disability in MS, 7 but its\\nchanges are not sufﬁciently dynamic to reﬂect SAW, and\\nits use is limited byﬂoor and ceiling effects, and by both\\nintra- and inter-rater variability.6\\nThe implementation of composite clinical outcome\\nmeasures, such as the MSFC9 and the EDSS-Plus (also\\ntermed Overall Disability Response Score [ODRS])13 rep-\\nresents an attempt to overcome these limitations, because\\nthey allow more comprehensive and earlier characteriza-\\ntion of disease worsening, enhancing our ability to pin-\\npoint relatively subtle changes in disability. By combining\\nthe EDSS with the timed 25-foot walk (T25W) and\\n9-hole peg test (9HPT), the EDSS-Plus can capture wider\\naspects of disability worsening.13 Among SPMS cases from\\nthe placebo arm of the IMPACT study, 59.5% experi-\\nenced disability progression as measured by the EDSS-\\nPlus, whereas only 24.7% met the conventional deﬁnition\\nof disability accumulation using the standard EDSS deﬁni-\\ntion.13 In line with these observations, in the combined\\npost hoc analyses of the ocrelizumab OPERA trials, with\\nthe implementation of the EDSS-Plus it has been demon-\\nstrated that the presence of PIRA occurs in a large propor-\\ntion of RRMS with stable inﬂammatory parameters.8 In\\naddition, the ODRS was found to be a sensitive and\\nenhanced tool for detecting progressive deterioration\\namong pwMS with RRMS and SPMS from the\\nAFFIRMS and ASCEND trials,117 further demonstrating\\nthe value of composite outcome measures for unmasking\\nelements of disease progression (independent of relapses)\\nespecially in the early stages.\\nHowever, subtle accumulation of symptoms and\\nsigns often does not even fulﬁl the yet unvalidated deﬁni-\\ntion of PIRA.118 This is predominantly based on clinical\\nscales mainly capturing changes in motor performance,\\nbut to a large extent insensitive to worsening in other clinical\\ndomains, such as cognitive performance, which is an impor-\\ntant aspect of smouldering disease in MS. Attempts have been\\nmade to integrate the EDSS with the Brief International Cog-\\nnitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) and with\\norientation tests (such as Mini Mental State Examination\\n[MMSE]), which unmasked cognitive impairment otherwise\\nundetected with standard clinical assessments.119\\nOverall, composite outcome measures cannot be eas-\\nily incorporated in routine practice, and a major challenge\\nwill be validating alternative measures that need to be\\nmultidimensional to provide a deeper insight into clini-\\ncally meaningful changes characterizing smouldering dis-\\nease in MS. Similar to cardiac stress tests, which are an\\nintegral part of an interventional cardiologist’s work-up,\\nneurological stress tests should be used to assess neurologi-\\ncal reserve by objectively measuring walking and/or run-\\nning distances and times, cognitive reaction times, gait\\nand balance analyses, and visual tests (Table 3). Three-\\ndimensional gait analysis has been implemented to capture\\nexercise-induced walking deterioration, which can be\\nhighlighted among individuals with moderate neurological\\ndisability (EDSS <3.5). 120 An accurate assessment of\\nfatigue, bladder/bowel symptoms, and sexual function can\\nalso help to uncover clinical evidence of SAW. Wearables\\nand sensor-based monitors provide a unique opportunity\\nto monitor individuals in a day-to-day setting.121 Using\\nengineered gloves, hands, and ﬁngers ﬁne motor perfor-\\nmance can be accurately monitored, unmasking subtle\\nworsening impairment, even among subjects with RIS.122\\n11\\nScalfari et al: International Consensus on Smouldering MS\\n 15318249, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27034 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [14/08/2024].

The physical MS impact scale (MSIS-29-Phys) was\\nused to assess the impact of fatigue124 and smoking125 on\\nwalking ability, highlighting its potential as an outcome\\nmeasure for SAW. In addition, recent analyses of the\\nORATORIO trial provided further evidence in support of\\nthe MSIS-29-Phys and Fatigue Score Motor and Cogni-\\ntion questionnaires as useful tools for predicting disability\\nprogression.126 However, fatigue trajectories can remain\\nrelatively stable over long time, implying that fatigue scales\\nmight have limited utility as dynamic measures. In this\\ncontext, the combined use of PROs scales and wearable\\ndevices121 might hold greater potential for monitoring\\nsubtle clinical deterioration resulting from SAW.\\nThe Health Utilities Index 3 (HUI3) represents\\nanother potentially useful PRO measure with strong psy-\\nchometric properties, which was found to be more efﬁ-\\ncient in detecting change in disability than other\\nmeasures.127 Bayas and colleagues128 demonstrated that\\nan online survey is considered an appropriate tool to gain\\nvaluable insights into the pwMS’s perceived disease course.\\nContinuous worsening of symptoms independent of\\nrelapses in the previous 12 months was reported by the\\nvast majority (88.9%) of RRMS cases with\\nmarked-to-severe disability and over half of cases with no\\nor mild-to-moderate disability.128\\nWith this array of clinical markers to detect subtle\\nchanges or worsening, there arises a compelling argument\\nfor the seamless integration of these tools into routine\\nclinical practice, and for supporting a paradigmatic shift in\\nroutine MS management.\\nIntegration into Clinical Practice\\nEvidence of smouldering pathology and progression across\\nthe spectrum of MS, even in the earliest stages, warrants a\\nrevision of the disease clinical phenotypes descriptors.4,6,11\\nAmong pwMS, we suggest using relapsing or progressive\\ndisease courses only as supplemental non-diagnostic\\ndescriptors to inform disease management. In addition,\\nHCPs should acknowledge that“clinically stable” individ-\\nuals may still worsen in several physical and cognitive\\ndomains, feeling ignored and frustrated because of their\\nunrecognized clinical deterioration. As an expert panel, we\\nhave set out several examples of probing questions that\\ncan help to uncover SAW in routine clinical practice\\n(Table S1).\\nNaturally, HCPs are uncomfortable identifying and\\ndiscussing smouldering disease in MS, because there are\\nno licensed treatments for preventing SAW yet. However,\\nopenly discussing smouldering disease with pwMS should\\nfacilitate managing their expectations about current MS\\ntreatment targets. Although DMTs impact positively on\\nthe natural course of the disease,129 the therapeutic sup-\\npression of focal inﬂammatory activity might have a lim-\\nited effect on the pathological substrate of smouldering\\ndisease.6 Despite NEIDA, SAW may still occur, albeit at a\\nlower rate than when pwMS are on treatment.8 Overall, it\\nremains unclear whether SAW occurs in all pwMS, as a\\nminority experience more favorable outcomes with a dis-\\nease course that remains relatively stable over the years.130\\nThis is more likely to occur when aggressive therapeutic\\nmanagement with high-ef ﬁcacy DMTs is implemented\\nearly in the disease.131\\nThe impact of smouldering disease in MS can also\\nbe potentially minimized by implementing a holistic man-\\nagement approach. This implies not only addressing MS-\\nspeciﬁc processes, but also preventing and/or treating\\ncomorbidities, which are known to be associated with\\npoor MS outcome.59 In addition, several potentially\\nmodiﬁable factors play important roles in determining\\nthe disease severity. Poorer health behaviors, such as\\nsmoking,132 lack of regular physical exercise, and\\nunhealthy dietary habits have been shown to correlate\\nwith lower quality of life,133 and social isolation, loneli-\\nness, unemployment, and low social capital were found\\nto predict poorer prognosis.134 Overall, efforts should\\nf o c u so np r o m o t i n gb r a i nh e a l t h135 by optimizing life-\\nstyle factors, including regular exercise, 136 stopping\\nsmoking, 125 maintaining a healthy diet 137 and good\\nsleep patterns. Because physical activity plays an impor-\\ntant role in general wellbeing, over recent years, yoga\\nhas gained increasing interest as an intervention that\\ncan potentially improve symptoms and quality of life\\namong pwMS. 138 This can be an attractive option to\\nempower pwMS and encourage their active involvement\\nin disease management. Finally, individuals with SAW\\nmay be eligible for clinical trials or be enrolled in non-\\ndrug interventions such as lifestyle, wellness, social, and\\ncognitive rehabilitation programs to optimize brain\\nhealth, 139 which may positively impact some of the\\nmechanisms driving their disease worsening (Table 4).\\n12 Volume 00, No. 0\\nANNALS of Neurology\\n 15318249, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27034 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [14/08/2024].

Assessing sample size and appropriate study design\\nwill need to immediately follow these efforts.\\nDiscussion\\nBy using the Delphi method, our international panel of\\nexperts aimed to provide clinicians and scientists with con-\\nsensus statements covering several aspects of smouldering\\ndisease in MS. The selection of panelists was based on\\nclinical experience, scienti ﬁc background and expertise,\\nand geographical representation. This ensured expert and\\nunbiased views on a wide range of key scientiﬁc areas.\\nHowever, we acknowledge that an independent panel of\\npwMS, would have provided additional useful perspectives\\nand insights about several aspects of smouldering\\nMS. Our conclusions were built on emerging clinical,\\nradiological, and pathological evidence supporting a para-\\ndigm shift in our understanding of the mechanisms con-\\ntributing to disease worsening. Our ultimate goal was to\\nunify the diverse and disparate views on smouldering\\nMS. It is now generally accepted that PIRA is a key deter-\\nminant of MS worsening from the earliest disease phase,\\nbut its quantiﬁcation is based on EDSS/EDSS-Plus, which\\ncan capture only to some extent clinically meaningful\\ndeterioration. Although PIRA is likely to be accepted by\\nregulators as an outcome measure in clinical trials, several\\nshortcomings prevent its implementation in routine clini-\\ncal practice, because its deﬁnition requires a re-baseline\\nand 3- to 6-monthly assessments to conﬁrm worsening, it\\ndoes not incorporate biomarkers, it is not underpinned\\nfrom a biological perspective, and it does not acknowledge\\nthe effects of aging. We recognize PIRA as one of the\\ncomponents of smouldering disease in MS, but in view of\\nits limitations, it should be reserved for EDSS-based met-\\nrics. Here, we challenge the dogmatic view of MS by pro-\\nposing the concept of SAW, encompassing PIRA, but also\\na wide range of physical and cognitive symptoms gradually\\nworsening in absence of relapses, which cannot be quanti-\\nﬁed by EDSS/EDSS-Plus (Fig2). SAW reconciles smoul-\\ndering pathobiological processes affecting the CNS with\\nworsening disability in multiple domains and addresses\\nmany of the shortcomings of PIRA.\\nOverall, RAW and SAW are the disease’s 2 main\\nclinical phenomena, which are underpinned by different\\npathology, both leading to permanent loss of function. In\\nour current disease management model, residual deﬁcit\\nfrom relapses can be detected with conventional clinical\\nand radiological tools, whereas more comprehensive assess-\\nments with clinical, imaging, and serum/CSF outcome\\nmeasures, which are yet not routinely implemented, are\\nrequired to unravel manifestations related to SAW (Fig2).\\nWe acknowledge the lack of a uniform de ﬁnition of\\nsmouldering MS, and we have developed a consensus-\\ndriven new lexicon (Table S2) to explain smouldering\\npathology and SAW to facilitate communications among\\npatients, HCPs, and other stakeholders and to promote\\nits integration in clinical practice.

In order to diagnose MS, multiple screening \\nmethods have been proposed so far; among them, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has received considerable \\nattention among physicians. MRI modalities provide physicians with fundamental information about the struc -\\nture and function of the brain, which is crucial for the rapid diagnosis of MS lesions. Diagnosing MS using MRI is \\ntime-consuming, tedious, and prone to manual errors. Research on the implementation of computer aided \\ndiagnosis system (CADS) based on artificial intelligence (AI) to diagnose MS involves conventional machine \\nlearning and deep learning (DL) methods.

In this paper, a complete review of automated MS diagnosis \\nmethods performed using DL techniques with MRI neuroimaging modalities is provided. Initially, the steps \\ninvolved in various CADS proposed using MRI modalities and DL techniques for MS diagnosis are investigated. \\nThe important preprocessing techniques employed in various works are analyzed.

Introduction \\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease wherein the \\nimmune system wrongly targets the central nervous system including \\nthe brain and spinal cord [ 1 ]. In MS, the nervous system, including the \\nmyelin sheath, nerve fibers, and even the cells that produce the myelin, \\nis usually damaged [ 2 ]. These injuries go away after few days to few \\nweeks if they are not very severe, but may cause permanent changes in \\nthe spinal cord if they are severe [ 3 , 4 ]. These permanent changes are \\ncalled sclerosis, and because these lesions occur in multiple and different \\nareas, the disease is called multiple sclerosis [ 5 , 6 ]. Due to this disease, \\nthe body immune system responds abnormally, causing inflammation \\n* Corresponding author. \\nE-mail address: afshin.shoeibi@gmail.com (A.

It is esti -\\nmated worldwide that the number of people suffering from this disease \\nhas increased to 2.3 million from 2013 [ 9 , 10 ]. ( Fig. 1 ) shows the number \\nof people with MS worldwide [ 11 ]. As shown in ( Fig. 1 ), North America, \\nEurope, and Australia have most of the MS patients [ 11 ]. \\nThere are four categories in MS: (i) clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) \\n[ 12 , 13 ], (ii) relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) [ 14 , 15 ], (iii) primary pro -\\ngressive MS (PPMS) [ 16 , 17 ], and (iv) secondary progressive MS (SPMS) \\n[ 18 , 19 ]. The CIS refers to the first episode of neurological symptoms that \\nlasts at least 24 h and is caused by inflammation or demyelination of the \\ncentral nervous system (CNS) [ 12 , 13 , 20 ]. CIS can be either mono-focal \\nor multi-focal [ 12 , 13 , 20 ]. The RRMS is the most common type of MS \\ndisease, characterized by clearly defined attacks, also known as relapses \\nor exacerbations of new or growing neurological symptoms, with in -\\ntervals of remission in between [ 14 , 15 , 21 ]. During remission, all \\nsymptoms may disappear, or some of them may continue and become \\npermanent. However, there is no apparent progression of the disease \\nduring these periods. RRMS can be active or inactive, worsening or not \\nworsening [ 14 , 15 , 21 , 22 ]. Around 85 % of people with MS are initially \\ndiagnosed with RRMS type of disease [ 14 , 15 , 21 , 22 ]. PPMS type of MS \\ndisease is characterized by worsening of neurological function (i.e., \\nincreased disability) since the onset of symptoms, with no early recur -\\nrence or recovery [1617], [ 23 ]. PPMS can be described as active or \\ninactive, with or without progression [ 16 , 17 , 23 ]. SPMS is followed by \\nan early relapse period. Few people with RRMS eventually switch to \\nSPMS, wherein there is a gradual deterioration of nerve function over \\ntime [ 18 , 19 , 24 ]. It can be also be characterized as either active or \\ninactive, with or without progression [ 18 , 19 , 24 ]. \\nCommon symptoms of MS include fatigue, difficulty in walking, \\nspasticity, weakness, vision problems, dizziness, cognitive changes, \\nemotional changes, depression, and more [ 25 – 27 ]. There are no known \\ncauses of MS disease [ 28 , 29 ]. Scientists believe that a combination of \\nenvironmental and genetic factors play a role in MS [ 30 , 31 ]. Environ -\\nmental factors such as geography, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, and \\nsmoking may have some correlation with MS [ 32 , 33 ]. \\nUnfortunately, there are currently no symptoms, physical findings, \\nor laboratory tests to accurately diagnose MS [ 34 , 35 ]. For this reason, \\nseveral methods are used to diagnose MS that include reviewing the \\npatient ’ s medical history [ 36 , 37 ], medical imaging techniques such as \\nMRI [ 38 – 40 ], spinal fluid analysis [ 41 , 42 ], and blood tests [ 43 , 44 ]. \\nCurrently, MRI modalities are the best non-invasive method used for the \\ndiagnosis of MS [ 45 – 47 ]. The myelin sheath, which protects nerve cell \\nfibers, contains fat and repels water. In areas where MS damages myelin \\nsheath, fat is stripped away. As fat is lost, this area keeps more water, \\nand depending on the type of MRI scan, it is seen as a light white spot or \\nlesions [ 48 , 49 ]. ( Fig. 2 ) displayed different structural MRI (sMRI) mo -\\ndalities for different subjects with the MS disease [ 79 , 80 ]. \\n( Fig. 2 ), illustrates various sMRI modalities used for the diagnosis of \\nMS which were recorded by a 3T scanner [ 79 , 80 ]. Fig. (2a) shows the \\nT1-weighted images of MS patients. The T2-weighted images of different \\nMS patients are displayed in Fig. (2b) . Fig. (2c) shows the T2-weighted \\nFLAIR images of MS patients. \\nDiagnosis of MS based on MRI neuroimaging modalities are time- \\nconsuming and challenging for physicians. Therefore, researchers are \\nproposing novel methods to accurately identify these fields. Nowadays, \\nAI techniques have emerged as an important tool for various disease \\ndiagnoses with the help of physicians [ 50 – 54 ]. AI techniques for medical \\ndiagnosis can be mainly split into (i) conventional machine learning \\nmethods and (ii) DL techniques [ 55 – 58 ]. \\nIn preliminary research, the conventional machine learning methods \\nwere used for diagnosis of MS using MRI modalities [ 27 – 29 ]. Use of \\nthese methods for the diagnosis of MS are highly time-consuming and \\nrequires significant amount of expertise in various AI fields. Also, several \\ndeficiencies related to conventional machine learning CADS include \\nhigh computational cost due to multiple algorithms, inefficient perfor -\\nmance with large amount of MRI input data, and so on. \\nOn the other hand, the DL methods are one of the latest fields of AI \\nwhich has gained considerable popularity to diagnose a variety of dis -\\neases using medical data [ 59 – 61 ]. One of the prominent features of DL \\nnetworks is their ability to infer and derive inherent and latent feature \\nrepresentations in MRI data [ 55 ]. Another advantage of DL is that it does \\nnot require any manual management of the feature extraction stage; this \\nallows the integration of feature extraction and classification steps in \\nCADS using DL [ 90 – 93 ]. Research in the field of MS diagnosis using MRI \\nmodalities and DL architectures has been initiated since 2016. The \\nresearch in this field comprised of the utilization of DL models for seg -\\nmentation and classification applications. \\nThis paper provides a review of studies conducted on the diagnosis of \\nMS using MRI modalities and DL techniques. DL techniques are used to \\nsegment the MS lesions, and to detect MS automatically using MRI \\nmodalities. These techniques are discussed in detail in the following \\nFig. 1.

CADS for MS detection in MRI modalities \\nToday, CADS based on AI techniques are exploited in various medical \\napplications [ 62 – 65 ]. The CADS in medicine can be implemented using \\nconventional machine learning and DL methods [ 66 – 68 ]. Generally, a \\nCADS construction comprises of dataset, preprocessing, feature extrac -\\ntion, feature selection, classification, and model evaluation steps [ 69 , \\n70 ]. One of the significant applications of CADS is the diagnosis of MS \\nusing MRI neuroimaging modalities. So far, numerous works have been \\naccomplished on the implementation of CADS based on conventional \\nmachine learning [ 27 – 29 ] and DL [ 168 – 170 ] techniques for MS \\ndetection. \\nThe main difference in CADS based on conventional machine \\nlearning and DL is in the feature extraction and feature selection steps \\n[ 71 , 72 ]. CADS utilizing conventional machine learning involve feature \\nextraction and feature selection algorithms using trial and error \\nmethods, requiring prior knowledge of image processing and AI \\nFig. 2.

Low performance is obtained with large amount of \\nMRI is another limitation of conventional machine learning-based \\nCADS. Another disadvantage of these methods in dealing with high ar -\\ntifacts and low contrast of MR images. \\nHowever, in CADS based on DL, these two steps are performed \\nintelligently by deep layers [ 75 , 76 ]. One advantage of DL is augmen -\\ntation of input data does not diminish the performance of CADS [ 55 ]. \\nAdditionally, DL models are robust to noisy MRI data [ 55 ]. Therefore, in \\nconclusion, it can be concluded that DL-based CADS have yielded higher \\nperformances in detecting MS using MRI modalities compared to con -\\nventional machine learning. ( Fig. 4 ) shows the CADS block diagram for \\nMS detection using DL techniques and MRI modalities. First, the datasets \\navailable are fed to the MS diagnosis system. Then, a variety pre -\\nprocessing techniques are performed on MRI modalities. Finally, a \\nrobust and accurate DL architecture is obtained to detect the MS \\nautomatically. \\n2.1. Datasets \\nIn this section, the most important available datasets used to di -\\nagnose MS using MRI neuroimaging modalities are discussed. There are \\nseveral datasets available for researchers to diagnose MS, including \\nMICCAI 2008 [ 77 ], MICCAI 2016 [ 78 ], ISBI 2015 [ 79 , 80 ], and eHealth \\nLab [ 81 ]. In the following, the details for available MS datasets based on \\nMRI neuroimaging modalities are presented. Also, a summary infor -\\nmation of these datasets are provided in Table 1 . \\n2.1.1. The MICCAI 2008 MS lesion segmentation challenge dataset \\nThis dataset contains MR images of research subjects from the Uni -\\nversity of North Carolina (UNC) and Boston Children ’ s Hospital (CHB) \\n[ 77 ]. All dataset images were segmented by one CHB expert and 2 UNC \\nexperts. The training database has 20 samples, of which 10 CHB samples \\nand 10 UNC samples were manually segmented from the CHB expert \\n[ 77 ]. The test dataset includes 25 samples (15 CHB samples and 10 UNC \\nsamples) without any segmentation [ 77 ]. In the dataset, all the modal -\\nities of T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR, DTI-derived FA, and MD images are pre -\\nsented. Also, several pre-processing steps have been performed on this \\ndatabase. More information is provided in Ref. [ 77 ]. \\n2.1.2. The MICCAI 2016 MS lesion segmentation challenge dataset \\nThe 2016 MICCAI dataset includes MR images of 53 people with MS \\n[ 78 ]. The images in this dataset were recorded from three different \\ncenters in France with four MRI scanners (Siemens, Philips, and GE) and \\ninclude three 3T magnets and one 1.5T magnet [ 78 ]. In this dataset, MR \\nimages have also been manually segmented by seven experts [ 78 ]. This \\ndataset is divided into training and testing. The training and testing set \\nincludes 15 and 38 patients, respectively [ 78 ]. Modalities of 3D FLAIR \\nsequence, T1 weighted sequence pre, and post-Gadolinium injection, \\naxial dual PD-T2 weighted sequence are provided for each patient. This \\nchallenge provided raw and preprocessed data for each patient [ 78 ]. \\n2.1.3. ISBI 2015 longitudinal MS lesion segmentation challenge dataset \\nThe ISBI 2015 dataset includes MR images of 19 MS patients with a \\ntraining and two test packages [ 79 , 80 ]. The training set has five sub -\\njects, four subjects with four-time points and one subject with five-time \\npoints [ 79 , 80 ]. The test set A consists of 10 subjects, eight of them with \\nfour-time points, one with five-time points, and one with six-time points \\n[ 79 , 80 ]. Test set B has four subjects, three with four-time points and two \\nwith five-time points. All subjects have T1-w MPRAGE, T2-w & PD-w \\nDSE, and T2-w FLAIR modalities. In this dataset, the original images, \\nas well as the pre-processed images, are available. Also, manual seg -\\nmentation has been conducted by two experts [ 79 , 80 ]. \\n2.1.4. eHealth lab \\nThis dataset provides MRI modalities of 38 patients (17 males, 21 \\nfemales) with a mean age of 34.1 ± 10.5 years with CIS of MS and MRI \\nbrain lesions, recorded twice with an interval of 6 – 12 months and with \\n1.5 T protocol [ 81 ]. \\n2.2. Preprocessing \\nDiagnosis of brain lesions using MRI modalities are clinically \\nimportant for the diagnosis of MS. Segmentation and classification of \\nbrain lesions from MRI modalities are extremely problematic for phy -\\nsicians and are prone to misdiagnosis. Various factors such as artifacts, \\nintensity heterogeneity, etc. have a destructive effect on the quality of \\nMR image, which often can lead to misdiagnosis of the disease. In the \\nfollowing, the low level and high level preprocessing methods in MRI \\nneuroimaging modalities for diagnosis of MS are discussed. Expressing \\nthese items prevents additional explanations of common preprocessing \\nmethods in Table 2 . \\n2.2.1. Low level preprocessing \\nIn this section, the most important low level preprocessing methods \\nfor sMRI modalities are introduced, which include denoising, in -\\nhomogeneity correction, skull-stripping, registration, intensity stan -\\ndardization, de-oblique, re-orientation and segmentation. These \\npreprocessing methods are consistent for all sMRI modalities.  \\n(1). Denoising \\nDuring the MRI recording process, images are usually corrupted by \\nvarious random noises [ 82 ]. Hence, several approaches are utilized to \\nremove noise from MRI modalities. Some of those methods are low-pass \\nfilters [ 83 ], Fourier filters [ 84 ], and wavelets [ 85 ].  \\n(2). Inhomogeneity correction \\nWhen the magnetic fields of MRI scanner strike the brain tissue, their \\nintensity decline, creating an artifact in the images [ 82 , 86 ]. This artifact \\nis observed as a low-frequency variation in signal intensity of MRI im -\\nages and should therefore be modified in the preprocessing step [ 82 , 86 ]. \\nTwo important methods are applied for inhomogeneity correction [ 82 , \\n86 ].

Non-brain Tissue Removal (skull-stripping) \\nIn neuroimaging studies, the regions of interest (ROI) are located in \\nthe brain tissue. Therefore, non-brain tissues such as skull, neck, eyes, \\nnose, and mouth are not important and should be eliminated [82,86]. \\nThis enhances the accuracy of CADS for MS detection [82,86].  \\n(4). Registration \\nIn MRI preprocessing, image registration is a prevalent step used to \\ncombine different types of image modalities or sequences (T1-and T2- \\nweighted images of the same subject) or to place images in a standard \\nspace such as MNI [82,86].  \\n(5). Intensity standardization \\nTypically, MR images acquired with the same protocol do not \\ncontain the same intensity among scanners. Even in a scanner with the \\nsame settings, in various sessions, the image intensity patterns vary [82, \\n86]. Intensity standardization techniques in MRI modalities attempt to \\ncorrect these scanner-dependent intensity variations [82,86]. The most \\npopular procedures used for intensity standardization in MRI modalities \\nare histogram matching techniques [82,86].  \\n(6). De-Oblique \\nThe oblique scanning is used to cover the whole brain while avoiding \\nthe artifacts caused by air and humidity in the eyes and nose. However, \\nthe oblique scanning makes registration of two different MR images \\nchallenging. So, a de-oblique preprocessing step should be done before \\nregistration [82,86].  \\n(7). Re-orientation \\nThe direction of the image depends on the settings of image regis -\\ntration process. Differences in direction may lead to misregistration, so \\nall images must have identical directions. Hence, re-orientation tech -\\nniques are employed [82,86].  \\n(8). Segmentation \\nThe aim of segmentation is to map the image into a set of meaningful \\nareas containing identical characteristics in terms of intensity, depth, \\ncolor, or structure [82,86,89]. In MRI modalities, the purpose of seg -\\nmentation is to isolate three types of tissues: white matter (WM), gray \\nmatter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [89]. \\n2.2.2. High level preprocessing (others preprocessing) \\nHigh level preprocessing techniques along with low level pre -\\nprocessing methods help to improve the performance of CADS. These \\nmethods include data augmentation (DA) [135], patch extraction [168], \\nROIs extraction [182], and so on. Detailed preprocessing information \\nemployed by each group (paper) for the diagnosis of MS using DL \\nmethods and MRI modalities are summarized in Table 2. \\n2.3. Deep leaning methods used for MS detection \\nNowadays, DL techniques are used in various medical fields \\nattracting lot of attention from many researchers [90–93]. One of these \\nareas is the diagnosis of brain diseases such as MS using MRI modalities. \\nTable (2) shows the types of DL networks used in MS diagnostic research \\nusing MRI modalities. It can be noted from after table (2), the most \\npopular DL architectures used for MS detection use convolutional neural \\nnetworks (CNNs) [94–96], Autoencoders (AEs) [94–96], generative \\nadversarial networks (GANs) [97–99], and CNN-RNN models [100]. \\nCNNs are the first class of DL techniques used in the supervised learning \\nmethods category. It can be noted from Table (2), that most of the re -\\nsearchers used various 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN models for segmentation \\nand classification of MRI modalities for MS detection. AEs are a group of \\nDL networks that are based on unsupervised learning. GAN architectures \\nare the recently developed DL models used for the MS diagnosis using \\nMRI modalities. In the following sections, we have briefly discussed \\nthese various DL networks that have been used for the diagnosis of MS. \\nAlso, details of DL networks are provided in appendix table A. \\n2.3.1. Convolutional neural networks \\nAn advantage of CNN models is that they do not need manual feature \\nextraction. In these models, as the network becomes deeper, the higher \\nlevel features are extracted [94–96]. Although CNNs have exhibited an \\nacceptable performance, this performance promotion has been attained \\nat the expense of increased computational complexities and, therefore, \\nthere is a need for more powerful processing hardware such as Graphical \\nProcessing Unit (GPU) and Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) [94–96]. In \\nthis section, the most significant CNN architectures used for automatic \\nsegmentation and classification of MS using MRI neuroimaging modal -\\nities are presented. First, different 2D and 3D CNNs models developed \\nfor MS classification are presented. Then, CNN architectures namely \\nU-Net [101] and FCN [102] developed for MR images segmentation are \\ndiscussed.  \\n(1). 2D and 3D-CNNs \\nCNNs are one of the most popular DL techniques, with a variety of \\napplications, including image segmentation [103,104], image classifi -\\ncation [105,106], and more [107,108]. These networks have a better \\ncompatibility with 2D and 3D images due to the reduction of parameter \\nnumbers and ability to reuse weights [94–96]. The most important \\ncomponents of a CNN architecture are convolutional, pooling, batch \\nnormalization, and fully connected layers [94–96]. By properly selecting \\nlayers on CNN, it is possible to learn the spatial and temporal de -\\npendencies of an image [94–96]. (Fig. 5) shows a 2D-CNN architecture \\nfor classification of MR images. \\nTable 1 \\nDetails of public datasets available for MS diagnosis.  \\nRef Dataset Number of \\nCases \\nModalities Description Link \\n[77] MICCAI \\n2008 \\nTrain 20 T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR, DTI-derived FA and MD Preprocessed https://www.nitrc.org/projects/msseg \\nTest 25 \\n[78] MICCAI \\n2016 \\nTrain 15 T1-w weighted, T1-w gadolinium enhanced (T1-w Gd), T2-w, \\nT2-FLAIR and PD-w images \\nPreprocessed http://www.miccai2016.org/en/ \\nTest 38 \\n[79, \\n80] \\nISBI 2015 Train 5 T1-w MPRAGE, T2-w & PD-w DSE, T2-w FLAIR Preprocessed https://smart-stats-tools.org/lesion-challenge-2015 \\nTest \\nA \\n10 \\nTest B 4 \\n[81] eHealth \\nLab \\n38 MRI – http://www.medinfo.cs.ucy.ac.cy/index.php/faciliti \\nes/32-software/218-datasets  \\nA.

Pre-Trained CNN Networks \\nDL architectures have numerous training parameters; hence, when \\nsmall datasets are used to train DL networks from scratch, they do not \\nyield good classification results. Therefore, transfer learning with pre- \\ntrained models can be used to address these issues. Pre-trained models \\nare first trained on a large dataset, such as ImageNet, and then their \\nclassification layer is replaced with a new layer specific for the problem \\nat hand [ 110 , 111 ]. Subsequently, by feeding new data as input to the \\npre-trained models, their weights are updated, enabling them to classify \\nthe data [ 112 ]. The disadvantage of these models is the use of ImageNet \\ndata for initial training, while MRI images are of gray-scale type. The \\nmost popular pre-trained models for classifying MRI modalities for MS \\ndiagnosis include LeNet, AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGGNet, ResNet, etc. \\n[ 109 – 112 ].  \\n(3). FCN Network \\nThis network was introduced by Long et al., which has taken \\nadvantage of available CNNs that learn hierarchies of features [ 102 ]. In \\nthis model, popular networks have transformed entirely convolutional \\nmodels by replacing FC layers with convolution layers to capture output \\nas a local map. These maps are up-sampled using the introduced \\nmethod. The deconvolution method is as follows: to simulate \\nup-sampling with size f, backward convolution method with stride size f \\nis employed on the output. These layers are also capable of learning. At \\nthe end of the network, there is a 1x1 convolution layer that yields the \\ncorresponding pixel label as the output. The exiting stride in the \\ndeconvolution stage constraints the output detail quantity of this layer. \\nTo address this issue and enhance the quality of results, several skip \\nconnections have been added to the network from the lower layers to the \\nend layer [ 102 ]. The main advantage of FCN is that it receives the input \\ndata with an arbitrary size, and produces a corresponding-sized output \\nwith efficient inference and learning [ 102 ]. The upsampling results are \\nrelatively fuzzy and insensitive to image details; segmentation results \\nare not good enough, which is the main disadvantage of this network. \\n( Fig. 6 ) shows the general fully convolutional network (FCN) block di -\\nagram used for automated brain MR images segmentation.  \\n(4). U-Net \\nU-Net is a well-known CNN architecture used for image segmenta -\\ntion that was first introduced by Ronneberger et al. [ 101 ]. This network \\npossesses two parts: an encoder and a decoder, by which image seg -\\nmentation operations are carried out [ 101 ]. In U-Net, the encoder sec -\\ntion consists of several down-sampling and convolutional layers [ 101 ]. \\nThe decoder section also comprises a number of up-sampling and \\nconvolution layers. In this network, skip connections relations are \\nplaced between the corresponding up-sampling and down-sampling \\nlayers [ 101 ]. An advantage of U-Net models is that, they can be \\ntrained with a limited number of data. The main difference between \\nU-Net and FCN is that the former is symmetrical and uses skip \\nconnections between two upsampling and down-sampling paths [ 101 ]. \\n( Fig. 7 ) shows the general U-Net block diagram used for brain MR im -\\nages segmentation.  \\n(5). Generative adversarial network (GAN) \\nGAN architectures are a novel class of DL models applied to a wide \\nvariety of applications in various fields [ 98 , 99 ]. In general, GAN net -\\nworks consist of two neural networks called the generator, G, and the \\ndiscriminator, D, [ 98 , 99 ]. The role of generator is to estimate the \\nprobability distribution of the original data to generate samples similar \\nto the original data [ 98 , 99 ]. The Discriminator, on the other hand, is \\ntrained to determine by likelihood estimation whether the sample is \\nfrom original data or artificial data generated by the generator [ 98 , 99 ]. \\nThe term GAN is used because the generator and discriminator are \\ntrained to compete with each other. In this way, the generator tries to \\nmislead the discriminator, whereas the discriminator attempts to iden -\\ntify better-generated samples [ 98 , 99 ]. The advantage of GAN models is \\nthat they do not require prior assumptions about the dataset, and are \\naimed to function with all data distributions [ 98 , 99 ]. The limitation of \\nthese models are the gradient vanishing problem and training \\ncomplexity, which can be resolved to some extent by performing \\nmathematical calculations in the network training phase. ( Fig. 8 ) dis -\\nplays a GAN model used for the brain MR images classification. \\n2.3.2. Autoencoder \\nAutoencoders (AEs) are a particular type of DL network aimed to find \\na low-dimensional representation of input data [ 95 , 96 ]. These models \\nconsist of two parts, an encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses \\nhigh-dimensional input data into lower-dimensional displays, known as \\nlatent space or bottleneck representation [ 95 , 96 ]. The decoder returns \\nthe data to the original dimensions of the input. Denoising AE, Sparse \\nAE, and Stacked AE are the most significant types of AE [ 95 , 96 ]. \\n2.3.3. CNN-RNN \\nHybrid CNN-RNN architecture have become popular among AI \\nprofessionals. This is due to the ability of CNN networks to learn spatial \\nfeatures and the ability of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architec -\\ntures to learn temporal features [ 100 ]. In CNN-RNN architectures, data \\nis often first fed to the CNN network input, and after passing through \\nseveral layers of convolution, feature maps that are the output of the \\nCNN network are applied to an RNN network [ 100 ]. The results reveal \\nthat adopting hybrid models such as CNN-RNN has been extremely \\nsuccessful in increasing the accuracy of CADS in brain disease diagnosis. \\n( Fig. 9 ) shows the CNN-RNN architecture for MR images classification. \\n3.

According to Table 2 , the discussion section is organized into \\nseveral subsections. Subsections of the discussion comprises of \\ncomparing conventional machine learning techniques with DL, types of \\nMS diagnosis applications, datasets, MRI modalities in MS diagnosis, \\nMRI preprocessing toolboxes, DL architectures, DL toolboxes, and finally \\nclassification algorithms in the diagnosis of MS. Also, the details of DL \\nnetworks developed for MS diagnosis are provided in appendix table A . \\nThey are briefly presented in the following sections. \\n3.1. Comparison of deep learning and conventional machine learning \\nmethods \\nResearch in the field of MS diagnosis using AI techniques is divided \\ninto two categories: conventional machine learning and DL. In Refs. \\n[ 27 – 29 ], various conventional machine learning works developed to \\ndiagnose MS from modalities are provided. In CADS based on conven -\\ntional machine learning, the main aim is to combine different algorithms \\ntogether (including preprocessing to classification) to achieve highest \\naccuracy. This is a relatively complex task and requires a great deal of \\nknowledge in the field of machine learning [ 93 ]. \\nIn recent years, DL techniques have received a particular position in \\nMS diagnosis [ 238 ]. Unlike conventional machine learning approaches, \\nDL techniques are highly effective in diagnosing MS. In CADS based on \\nDL methods, deep layers are exploited to extract the features [ 238 ]. This \\nenhanced the effectiveness of CADS in MS diagnosis. The application of \\nDL techniques have yielded hope for accurate diagnosis of MS using MRI \\nmodalities. \\n3.2. Comparison of deep learning applications for diagnosis of MS \\nIn this section, a comparison between various applications based on \\nDL methods for diagnosing MS are presented. It can be noted from \\nTable 2 that the majority of works have been focused on segmentation \\nand classification approaches, or combination of both as shown in \\n( Fig. 10 ). It can be noted from the Figure that it is important to perform \\nsegmentation to diagnose MS. This will help to identify the MS lesions on \\nMR images. The DL techniques can be used to recognize the exact \\nlocation and dimensions of the MS lesion, which will help the clinicians \\nto confirm their diagnosis. There are datasets available with manual \\nsegmentation of MR images. This has paved the way to have more seg -\\nmentation works being done using DL techniques with MRI neuro -\\nimaging modalities. \\n3.3. Comparison of available MRI datasets for diagnosis of MS \\nSeveral available datasets of MRI modalities have been introduced \\nfor the automated diagnosis of MS. The available MRI datasets for the \\nautomated MS diagnosis are given in Table 1 . In Table 2 , the clinical \\ndatasets on diagnosis of MS are listed. ( Fig. 11 ) illustrates the number of \\ndatasets employed to diagnose MS. It can be seen, that most of the works \\nhave used clinical data. Among the available datasets, ISBI 2015 is the \\nmost frequently used one for MS diagnosis research. This dataset con -\\ntains different types of sMRI modalities, and motivated its application in \\nmajority of relevant studies. \\n3.4. Comparison of MRI neuroimaging modalities for diagnosis of MS \\nPrevious sections explained different types of neuroimaging modal -\\nities for MS diagnosis. As presented in Table 1 , so far, datasets with sMRI \\nmodalities have been provided for research purposes. MRI neuro -\\nimaging modalities for the diagnosis of MS are explained in another \\nsection of Table 2 . It can be noted from Table 2 that the number of MRI \\nmodalities used in the MS diagnosis is depicted in ( Fig. 12 ). It can be \\nseen from this Figure, that the use of sMRI modalities to diagnose MS has \\ngrown more than other neuroimaging modalities. Based on Fig. 12 , few \\nresearchers have employed PET imaging in addition to sMRI modalities \\nfor MS diagnosis, thereby enhancing the precision and efficiency of \\nCADS. \\n3.5. Comparison of various MRI preprocessing toolboxes for diagnosis of \\nMS \\nAs mentioned in the previous sections, preprocessing is an important \\nstep in MRI. The pre-processing of MRI modalities has certain stages, as \\npresented in Section 2.2 . The implementation of these pre-processing \\nsteps are usually time-consuming, and several toolboxes have been \\nproposed to overcome this problem. Various toolboxes have been used \\nfor low-level preprocessing of MRI modalities, the most important of \\nwhich are the FMRIB software library (FSL) [ 195 ], FreeSurfer [ 196 ], \\nstatistical parametric mapping (SPM) [ 197 ], and Matlab. The number of \\nMRI preprocessing toolboxes used to detect MS are shown in ( Fig. 13 ). It \\ncan be seen, that the FSL toolbox is widely used in many works. \\n3.6. Comparison of different DL methods for diagnosis of MS \\nThis review mainly examines different DL methods developed for MS \\ndiagnosis. The most well-known DL techniques for MS diagnosis based \\non MRI modalities are presented in Section 2.3 . Based on Section 2.3 , DL \\nsegmentation and classification methods have been employed for MS \\ndiagnosis. Among DL methods, only CNN models are employed in \\ndifferent types of segmentation and classification techniques. The type \\nof DL model used for automated MS detection using MRI modalities are \\ngiven in Table 2 . The number of DL networks used every year for MS \\ndiagnosis is shown in ( Fig. 14 ). It can be noted from this Figure that CNN \\nmodels have been widely used to diagnose MS from MRI modalities. The \\npopularity of CNN models compared to other DL techniques lies in \\ngetting high performance using brain MR images. \\nFig. 6. Block diagram of FCN used for automated MS detection.  \\nA.

Comparison of different DL toolboxes for diagnosis of MS \\nNumerous toolboxes have been provided for implementing DL \\nmodels by companies such as Google or Facebook. The various tools \\nused to develop DL architectures are shown in Table 2 . The most \\nimportant DL tools are TensorFlow, Keras, Caffe, and PyTorch \\n[ 198 – 200 ]. Various DL toolboxes used by authors are also shown in \\nTable (2). The number of DL toolboxes used in automated MS diagnosis \\nis displayed in ( Fig. 15 ). It can be noted from ( Fig. 15 ) that the Keras \\ntoolbox is the most used system to MS detection using MRI modalities. \\nKeras is a powerful, free-of-charge, easy-to-use, and open-source library \\nfor the development and evaluation of DL models. It covers one nu -\\nmerical machine learning library of TensorFlow, and allows researchers \\nto easily implement DL models. Hence, Keras is the most popular library \\namong DL researchers for diagnosis of MS. \\n3.8.

Challenges \\nIn this section, the most important challenges in the automated MS \\ndiagnosis using MRI neuroimaging modalities and DL techniques are \\ndiscussed. The inaccessibility of available sMRI databases belonging to \\nmore subjects and different modalities is the first challenge. The second \\nchallenge is the inaccessibility of datasets with functional neuroimaging \\nmodalities for MS diagnosis research. Finally, DL models and hardware \\nresources remain the third challenge. These challenges are discussed \\nbelow. \\n4.1. Unavailable big data sMRI datasets with different modalities \\nIn the automated MS diagnosis, huge datasets are needed to obtain \\nhighest classification performance. The datasets available have a finite \\nnumber of subjects and therefore advanced DL models cannot be \\nemployed to investigate them. In segmentation applications, the prin -\\ncipal objective is to apply a DL method to delineate the MS lesions in the \\nMRI modalities. This can be achieved when the DL network is first \\ntrained using a huge number of MR images. This huge number of images \\nobtained from large number of subjects need to be manually delineated \\nand fed as input to perform automated segmentation. \\n4.2. Unavailable functional neuroimaging modalities for MS diagnosis \\nThis section addresses the most important challenges of functional \\nneuroimaging modalities in the diagnosis of MS. The most important \\nchallenges include the inaccessibility of available fMRI datasets and \\nother functional neuroimaging datasets. They are briefly discussed \\nbelow.  \\n(1). Unavailable fMRI datasets \\nThe unavailability of functional MRI (fMRI) datasets is the key \\nchallenge. fMRI modalities yield important information about brain \\nfunction to specialist physicians and neurologists [ 60 ]. fMRI modalities \\ncontain two categories: rs-fMRI and Task-fMRI [ 60 ]. Specialists have \\nconcluded that fMRI modalities are effective in diagnosing brain dis -\\neases, including MS [ 239 ]. In clinical studies, there have been much \\ndebate on the importance of using fMRI to automatically diagnose MS \\n[ 201 – 203 ]. Hlu ˇstík [ 239 ] in a study indicated that applying fMRI mo -\\ndalities in the diagnosis of MS is of great significance. In this study, \\nmotor, visual and cognitive networks in MS patients were examined \\nusing fMRI modalities. One of the advantages of fMRI modalities is that \\nthey can determine the location of MS based on the functioning of brain \\nneurons. But fMRI modalities are more complex than sMRI modalities. \\nThis has led to research into the diagnosis of MS using fMRI modalities \\nand AI techniques. \\nIn [ 204 , 205 ], A few researchers have taken the advantage of fMRI \\nneuroimaging modalities alongside AI techniques to detect MS and have \\nachieved satisfactory results. Unfortunately, the lack of access to fMRI \\ndatasets involving large number of subjects has prevented researchers \\nfrom developing accurate and robust DL techniques to diagnose MS. The \\navailability of fMRI datasets with large number of subjects helps the \\nresearchers to develop an accurate MS diagnosis model which can assist \\nthe physicians to confirm their manual screening. \\nFig. 10.

Unavailable other functional neuroimaging datasets \\nFurthermore, the lack of accessibility to datasets from other struc -\\ntural neuroimaging modalities is another challenge. Few clinical studies \\nhave used electroencephalogram (EEG), functional near-infrared spec -\\ntroscopy (fNRIS), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to diagnose MS \\n[ 206 – 210 ]. Also, few authors have used EEG signals with conventional \\nmachine learning algorithms to detect MS [ 211 – 213 ] automatically. \\nRecently many multimodality techniques have been proposed to \\naccurately diagnose brain disorders with satisfactory outcomes \\n[ 214 – 216 ]. Very few clinical works have been conducted to diagnose MS \\nusing multimodality techniques such as EEG-fMRI [ 217 ] and MEG-fMRI \\n[ 218 ]. The performance of the system can be improved by using data \\nfusion techniques. \\n4.3. Dl methods and hardware ’ s \\nAnother challenge is the selection of DL approach and hardware \\nresources. The development of a DL method to distinguish MS using MRI \\nmodalities demands more images and experience. Lack of access to \\nadequate hardware resources to implement DL architectures is another \\nbig challenge. Although servers such as Google Colab, Amazon, and \\ncater good hardware resources are available for researchers to train DL \\nnetworks, using these servers in the real world is a big challenge and \\nrises privacy concerns. \\n5. Future directions in the automated MS diagnosis using DL \\ntechniques \\nIn this section, directions for future work on MS diagnosis based on \\nMRI neuroimaging modalities and DL techniques are delineated. Future \\nresearch directions include three categories: datasets, application of \\nnovel DL models, and rehabilitation systems for MS patients. \\n5.1. Future works in datasets for automatic diagnosis of MS \\nThe available datasets for MS diagnosis are presented in Table 1 . It \\ncan be noted from Table (1) that most of the available sMRI datasets are \\nsmall (limited subjects). Hence, the developed automated systems for \\nMS diagnosis may not be accurate and robust. As a future research di -\\nrection, proposing sMRI datasets with large number of subjects will help \\nto design a practical software for MS diagnosis. \\nLack of access to datasets of functional modalities such as fMRI is \\nanother challenge in MS diagnosis. As a future work, we propose to have \\nmore accessible datasets of fMRI modalities for conducting research on \\nMS diagnosis. This can pave the way for developing more accurate \\nsystems for screening of brain function of MS patients by using DL \\ntechniques and fMRI modalities. \\nIn [ 125 ], the PET functional modality is used for MS diagnosis. In the \\nfuture, presenting accessible datasets of PET modality can contribute to \\nconducting applied studies in this domain. Physicians in clinical \\nresearch have utilized combined modalities such as PET and MRI to \\ndiagnose brain diseases [ 240 – 242 ]. Free available of such combined \\ndatasets (PET and MRI modalities) can be used to develop automated \\nsystems for MS diagnosis. \\nFig. 12.

The T1-w modality, however, is often used to segment the brain \\ntissue. MS lesions are usually manifest as hyperintensities in the T2-w \\nand PD-w modalities [ 223 ]. The major drawback of these two modal -\\nities are the similarity in lesion intensities and CSF, which makes the \\nsegmentation difficult. In such cases, the T2-FLAIR modality can be of \\ngreat significance, but this modality becomes problematic when dealing \\nwith subcortical structures [ 223 ]. Therefore, in future, DL models with \\nseveral neuroimaging modalities can help to identify and segment the \\nlesion of MS disease. \\n5.2. Future works in DL methods for automatic diagnosis of MS \\nRecently, GAN models have been introduced in medical applications \\nand a lot of research is being done in this field [ 228 – 230 ]. As mentioned, \\nthe lack of medical data is an obstacle for training DL networks. GAN \\nmodels have mostly been able to address the lack of medical data to train \\nDL networks [ 228 – 230 ]. For this purpose, various GANs can be \\nemployed to generate large amounts of MRI modalities in the future \\nworks of MS diagnosis. Additionally, some novel models such as graph \\ntheory-based architectures [ 231 , 232 ], zero-shot learning [ 233 – 235 ], \\nand representation learning [ 236 , 237 ] can be used by researchers as \\nfuture works in MS diagnosis using MRI neuroimaging modalities. \\nFig. 14.

Future works in design of rehabilitation systems for automatic \\ndiagnosis of MS \\nCloud computing is a novel medical technology that has attracted \\nconsiderable attention from researchers [ 243 – 245 ]. It allows re -\\nsearchers to store large MRI data in a cloud space. DL methods can also \\nbe implemented and simulated in the cloud space. It is expected that \\nfuture works employ cloud computing to study MS diagnosis based on \\nMRI modalities and DL methods. \\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is another developing technology in the \\nmedical industry [ 246 – 248 ]. Access to neurologists is challenging in \\nmost treatment centers. Thus, in the future, the use of IoT and DL \\ntechnologies can facilitate the process of treatment and diagnosis for MS \\npatients. \\n6. Conclusion \\nMS is a chronic disease that directly attacks the central nervous \\nsystem, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves [ 219,220 ]. \\nEarly diagnosis of MS is of great significance as it can prevent the pro -\\ngression of the disease and save life [ 221,222 ]. MRI neuroimaging \\nmodalities provide important information about brain tissue and \\nstructure to specialist physicians. Therefore, MRI modalities are widely \\nused to obtain the presence of MS lesions. Various methods have been \\nproposed to diagnose the MS using MRI modalities and machine learning \\ntechniques. In this paper, different components of CADS employed for \\nMS diagnosis using DL, and automated MS detection systems developed \\nare presented in Table (2). \\nThe works done on MS diagnosis using MRI modalities and DL \\ntechniques are presented in the discussion, This section discusses the \\ncomparison of conventional machine learning techniques and deep \\nlearning, available MRI datasets, MRI modalities, MRI preprocessing \\ntoolboxes, DL models, DL toolboxes, and classifier methods. \\nThe most important challenges of MS diagnosis with MRI modalities \\nand DL techniques are delineated. The inaccessibility of huge sMRI \\ndatasets belonging to diverse population and lack of access to fMRI \\nmodalities are among the most important dataset-related challenges \\nwhich are discussed in detail. Moreover, DL-related challenges include \\nresearchers ’ lack of access to powerful hardware resources for MS \\ndiagnosis research. \\nFuture work suggestions are presented in a section of the paper. They \\nfocus on developing more available public datasets of sMRI modalities, \\nfunctional neuroimaging modalities (fMRI and PET), and implementa -\\ntion of rehabilitation systems for MS patients.  \\nAppendix A.

The ob-\\njective of this multicentre, observational, retrospective cohort study was to investigate the contribution of relapse-asso-\\nciated worsening and progression independent of relapse activity to conﬁrmed disability accumulation in patients with\\nclinically isolated syndrome and early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, assessed within one year from onset and\\nwith follow-up≥5y e a r s(n = 5169). Data were extracted from the Italian Multiple Sclerosis Register. Conﬁrmed disability\\naccumulation was deﬁned by an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale score conﬁrmed at 6 months, and classiﬁed\\nper temporal association with relapses. Factors associated with progression independent of relapse activity and relapse-\\nassociated worsening were assessed using multivariable Cox regression models. Over a follow-up period of 11.5 ± 5.5\\nyears, progression independent of relapse activity occurred in 1427 (27.6%) and relapse-associated worsening in 922\\n(17.8%) patients. Progression independent of relapse activity was associated with older age at baseline [hazard\\nratio (HR) = 1.19; 95% conﬁd e n c ei n t e r v a l( C I )1 . 1 3–1.25, P < 0.001], having a relapsing–remitting course at baseline (HR =\\n1.44; 95% CI 1.28–1.61, P < 0.001), longer disease duration at baseline (HR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.28–1.90, P < 0.001), lower\\nExpanded Disability Status Scale at baseline (HR = 0.92; 95% CI 0.88–0.96, P < 0.001) and lower number of relapses before\\nthe event (HR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.73–0.80, P < 0.001). Relapse-associated worsening was associated with younger age at base-\\nline (HR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.81–0.93,P < 0.001), having a relapsing–remitting course at baseline (HR = 1.55; 95% CI 1.35–1.79,P <\\n0.001), lower Expanded Disability StatusScale at baseline (HR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.89–0.99, P = 0.017) and a higher number of\\nrelapses before the event (HR = 1.04; 95% CI 1.01–1.07, P < 0.001). Longer exposure to disease-modifying drugs was asso-\\nciated with a lower risk of both progression independent of relapse activity and relapse-associated worsening (P <\\n0.001). This study provides evidence that in an early relapsing-onset multiple sclerosis cohort, progression independent\\nof relapse activity was animportant contributor to conﬁrmeddisabilityaccumulation. Ourﬁndings indicate that insidious\\nprogression appears even in the earliest phases of the disease, suggesting that inﬂammation and neurodegeneration can\\nrepresent a single disease continuum, in which age is one of the main determinants of disease phenomenology.\\n1 Department of NEUROFARBA, University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy\\n2 Department of Neurology, IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi, 50143 Florence, Italy\\nReceived October 16, 2021.

The Italian Multiple Sclerosis Register was approved by\\nthe Policlinico of Bari Ethics Committee and by the local ethics com-\\nmittees in all participating centres. Written informed consent was\\nobtained from all enrolled patients in accordance with the\\nDeclaration of Helsinki. The minimum data set required for this\\nstudy also comprised the main demographic characteristics, the\\ndate of disease onset, clinical course, follow-up visit dates,\\nExpanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)6 scores recorded at each\\nvisit, the date of all relapses, start and end dates of all DMTs and\\nDMT type. Quality assurance through online certiﬁcation of EDSS\\ncompetency is required at each participating site. Inclusion criteria\\nwere: patients with aﬁrst neurological evaluation within 1 year\\nfrom the ﬁrst demyelinating event; CIS or RR course at theﬁrst\\nneurological evaluation; a minimum of three visits with EDSS\\nevaluation; a minimum of 5 years follow-up. We excluded patients\\nwith a PP and SP course at theﬁrst neurological evaluation and\\nthose enrolled in randomized controlled trials. The baseline was\\ndeﬁned as theﬁrst neurological evaluation with EDSS scoring. If\\nthe ﬁrst evaluation occurred within 30 days from a relapse, baseline\\nwas deﬁned as the following assessment with EDSS scoring per-\\nformed outside of a relapse and within theﬁrst year from disease\\nonset. When re-baseline was not possible, patients were excluded.\\nMultiple sclerosis duration was calculated from theﬁrst demyelin-\\nating event. The follow-up time was deﬁned as the time between\\nthe ﬁrst and last available EDSS entry.\\nConﬁrmed disability accrual (CDA) was deﬁned as ≥24-week\\nconﬁrmed disability increase from study baseline, measured by\\nEDSS (increase≥1.5 points if baseline EDSS = 0; increase≥1.0 point\\nif baseline EDSS≥1.0 and ≤5.5; increase ≥0.5 point if baseline\\nEDSS ≥6.0). The date of CDA was assigned at theﬁrst EDSS score\\nat which an increase occurred. RAW events were deﬁned as a sub-\\nset of CDA events. In these, the initial disability increase from study\\nbaseline occurred≤90 days after or≤30 days before the onset of a\\nrelapse. Otherwise, PIRA was deﬁned as a CDA event occurring\\n>90 days after and >30 days before the onset of a relapse.\\nIn a subgroup of patients with an MRI assessment≤90 days be-\\nfore or≤30 days after the CDA, progression independent of relapse\\nand radiological activity (true PIRA) was deﬁned as a CDA event oc-\\ncurring >90 days after and >30 days before the onset of a relapse and\\nthe presence of disease activity at the MRI evaluation (T1\\ngadolinium-enhancing lesions and/or T2 new/enlarging lesions).\\nOtherwise, CDA events occurring≤90 days after or≤30 days before\\nthe onset of a relapse and/or the presence of disease activity at the\\nMRI evaluation were deﬁned as relapse and/or radiological activity\\nassociated worsening (true RAW).\\nA relapse was deﬁned as the occurrence of new symptoms or the\\nexacerbation of existing symptoms that persisted for 24 h or more\\nin the absence of concurrent illness or fever and that occurred 30\\ndays or more after a previous relapse.7\\nTransition to SP was deﬁned according to the following deﬁni-\\ntions: (i) The neurologist deﬁnition, based on the subjective deci-\\nsion made by the neurologists according to the Lublin criteria for\\nSP.8,9 For this deﬁnition, the date of SP conversion assigned by the\\nneurologists was used. (ii) A data-driven algorithm based on a pre-\\nvious published deﬁnition10 with some modiﬁcations: a PIRA event\\nwith a minimum EDSS score of 4.0 at the time of conversion to SP\\nmultiple sclerosis and at the end of follow-up (ﬁnal EDSS≥4.0).\\nFor this deﬁnition, the date of PIRA event was assigned to SP\\nconversion.\\nFor DMT exposure, the proportion of time during which patients\\nreceived DMT was deﬁned by the recorded starting and ending\\ndates. The total time a patient spent on treatment was calculated in-\\ncluding any switches and gaps in treatment. We did not consider\\ngaps <3 months as a therapy interruption. For DMT in which ex-\\ntended treatment effects are recognized, the estimated treatment\\neffect duration was used to calculate the proportion of time that pa-\\ntients received therapy (6 months for mitoxantrone, rituximab,\\nocrelizumab; 5 years for alemtuzumab and autologous haematopoi-\\netic stem-cell transplantation; 2 months for natalizumab; 12\\nmonths for cladribine).11\\nThe following sensitivity analyses were carried out: (i) by includ-\\ning patients with the ﬁrst neurological evaluation on or after\\n1 January 2000; and (ii) CDA events were reclassiﬁed considering a\\ntime window of 365 days instead of 90 days as previously speciﬁed.\\nStatistical analysis\\nThe baseline and follow-up characteristics were expressed as mean\\nand SD or frequency and percentage for continuous and categorical\\ncovariates, respectively. Categorical and continuous variables were\\ncompared by using chi2 statistic, Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–\\nWallis tests, as appropriate.\\nFactors associated with ofﬁrst 24-week CDA (PIRA or RAW) and\\ntransition to SP were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional\\nhazard regressions. The proportional hazard assumption was as-\\nsessed through graphical inspection of residuals and scaled\\nSchoenfeld residuals test. In case of assumption violation, inter-\\naction terms between the covariates and time were added to the\\nmodel.12 The date of theﬁrst visit with full EDSS evaluation was\\nused as time origin of the model. In the absence of outcome occur-\\nrence, data were censored at the latest EDSS available. The expos-\\nure time was censored at the reaching of the outcome or at the\\nlast visit. Results of Cox regression models were expressed as haz-\\nard ratio (HR) and 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) of reaching the out-\\ncomes. The multivariable modelling analyses on theﬁrst 24-week\\nCDA (PIRA and RAW) were adjusted for the following covariates:\\nsex (female versus male), symptom at onset (multifocal versus uni-\\nfocal), age atﬁrst visit (≤20, 21–30, 31–40, 41–50, 51–60, ≥61 years),\\ndisease duration atﬁrst visit, disease course (RR versus CIS) and\\nEDSS score atﬁrst visit, number of relapses before the event, per-\\ncentage of time spent on DMT before the event, number of EDSS\\nevaluations before the event.

Characteristics of the study sample are depicted inTable 1.\\nOver a follow-up period of 11.5 ± 5.5 years, CDA occurred in 2349\\n(45.4%) patients. Patients with CDA had lower EDSS at baseline\\n(1.5/1.6 versus 1.8), longer follow-up duration (12.7/13.7 versus\\n10.1 years) and were less frequently treated with DMT during the\\nfollow-up period before the event (15.3/22.8% versus 86.7%;\\nTable 1). As for theﬁrst DMT, 2712 (93.2%) patients received plat-\\nform therapies (interferons, glatiramer acetate, teriﬂunomide, di-\\nmethyl fumarate) while 199 (6.8%) received highly effective\\ntreatments (natalizumab,ﬁngolimod, cladribine, alemtuzumab,\\nmitoxantrone, rituximab, ocrelizumab). CDA patients had higher\\nEDSS score at the end of the follow-up (3.7 versus 1.4;Table 1).\\nFactors associated withﬁrst RAW and PIRA event\\nPIRA (n = 1427) accounted for 60.7% ofﬁrst CDA and were already\\ndetectable in theﬁrst years of follow-up, becoming more frequent\\nthan RAW since the second year (Fig. 2). On the whole, 682 out of\\n1427 (47.8%)ﬁrst PIRA and 570 out of 922 (61.8%)ﬁrst RAW events\\noccurred during theﬁrst 5 years of follow-up.\\nIn the multivariable analysis, RAW was associated with younger\\nage at baseline (HR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.81–0.93, P < 0.001), having a RR\\ncourse at baseline (HR = 1.55; 95% CI 1.35–1.79, P < 0.001), lower\\nEDSS at baseline (HR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.89–0.99, P = 0.017), higher num-\\nber of relapses before the event (HR = 1.04; 95% CI 1.01–1.07,\\nP < 0.001) and shorter exposure to DMT before the event (HR = 0.16;\\n95% CI 0.12–0.20, P < 0.001;Table 2). The survival curve for the risk\\nof RAW in treated and untreated patients is reported inFig. 3A.\\nOn the other hand, in the multivariable analysis, PIRA was asso-\\nciated with older age at baseline (HR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.13–1.25,\\nP < 0.001), having a RR course at baseline (HR = 1.44; 95% CI 1.28–\\n1.61, P < 0.001), longer disease duration at baseline (HR = 1.56; 95%\\nCI 1.28–1.90, P < 0.001), lower EDSS at baseline (HR = 0.92; 95% CI\\n0.88–0.96, P < 0.001), lower number of relapses before the event\\n(HR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.73–0.80, P < 0.001) and shorter exposure to\\nDMT before the event (HR = 0.18; 95% CI 0.15 –0.22, P < 0.001;\\nTable 3). The survival curve for the risk of PIRA in treated and un-\\ntreated patients is reported inFig. 3B.\\nA subgroup of 359 of 2349 (15.3%) CDA patients had an MRI as-\\nsessment close to the event. Spinal cord MRI was available in 217\\ncases (60.4%). According to clinical deﬁnition, 187 RAW (52.1%)\\nand 172 PIRA (47.9%) occurred. Taking into account MRI activity,\\ntrue PIRA decreased to 84 (23.4%), while the remaining 275 (76.6%)\\nCDA events were reclassiﬁed as true RAW. Factors associated\\nwith true RAW and true PIRA were comparable to those of RAW\\nand PIRA (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). In particular, true RAW\\nwas associated with having an RR course at baseline (HR = 1.73;\\n95% CI 1.33–2.26, P < 0.001), lower EDSS at baseline (HR = 0.75; 95%\\nCI 0.67–0.84, P < 0.001), higher number of relapses before the event\\n(HR = 1.15; 95% CI 1.08–1.23, P < 0.001) and shorter exposure to\\nDMT before the event (HR = 0.07; 95% CI 0.05 –0.11, P < 0.001;\\nSupplementary Table 1).

Notably, all patients were diagnosed with CIS or RR multiple\\nsclerosis and had theﬁrst EDSS evaluation within 1 year from on-\\nset. On the one hand, this could limit the generalizability of our\\nﬁndings, as the majority of people with multiple sclerosis actually\\nattend the clinic >1 year after onset. Indeed, patients included in\\nthe present study were younger (31.8 ± 9.9 versus 37.7 ± 10.5 years,\\nP< 0.001) and less disabled (EDSS score 1.7 ± 1.2 versus 2.3 ± 1.5,P <\\n0.001) than CIS and RR multiple sclerosis subjects with aﬁrst visit\\nperformed >1 year form disease onset. On the other hand, however,\\nour cohort is ideal to establish a proof-of-principle about the role of\\nPIRA in theﬁrst years of the disease. Therefore, our data clearly\\ndemonstrate that underlying disease progression is already rele-\\nvant in the earliest phases of multiple sclerosis, suggesting that\\nthe disease could be considered as a continuum in which relapse-\\ndependent and -independent disability worsening takes place\\nsince onset. The key determinant is the way by which CDA occurs\\nappears to be age, with RAW events being more frequent in younger\\npatients and PIRA predominant in older patients.\\nThe inﬂuence of age on multiple sclerosis course has been\\nconsistently reported since the early epidemiological studies.13\\nIn the natural history cohorts, age at assignment of disability\\nlandmarks was not substantially inﬂu e n c e db yt h et y p eo ft h ei n i -\\ntial course of multiple sclerosis (be it RR or progressive) and mean\\nage at onset of the progressive phase was similar between PP\\nmultiple sclerosis and SP multiple sclerosis patients.14,15 These\\nobservations induced a unitary hypothesis,15 proposing multiple\\nsclerosis as one-stage disorder in which acute focal recurrent in-\\nﬂammation and diffuse chronic progressive neurodegeneration\\nare tightly intermingled since the outset of the disease. Several\\nstudies demonstrated the converse relationship between age\\nand number of attacks,16–18 with aﬂorid inﬂammatory activity re-\\nported in younger patients and a gradual relapse decrease in fre-\\nquency with age.\\nAt the neuropathological and immunological levels, the role\\nof age could be explained, at least in part, by immunosenes-\\ncence19 and inﬂamm-aging 20 processes.

With advancing age, immunosenescence\\ndecreases the activity and efﬁcacy of the adaptive system, while\\na ‘chronic’inﬂammatory status, mainly sustained by the innate\\nimmune system, tends to emerge. In this scenario,‘silent’neuro-\\ndegeneration and disease progression can occur. Interestingly,\\nactivation of microglia in the perilesional normal-appearing\\nwhite matter as detected by translocator protein–PET imaging\\nhas been linked to later PIRA over 4-year follow-up period. 21\\nMoreover, smouldering lesions, in which the slowly expanding\\nedge is mainly populated by activated microglia, are considered\\nas markers of the progressive phase.22 Therefore, it would be of\\ninterest to assess whether the presence of smouldering lesions\\nis associated with higher risk of PIRA.\\nA higher number of relapses was associated with RAW events,\\nwhile PIRA was related to lower relapse rate before CDA. This\\nﬁnding is not surprising, as a more ‘inﬂammatory ’ clinical\\nphenotype is more likely to determine RAW, while a lower num-\\nber of relapses reveals underlying‘silent’progression, as shown\\nin recent observations.2,4 For instance, in the pooled analysis of\\ntwo randomized clinical trials on ocrelizumab in RR multiple\\nsclerosis, the suppression of relapse activity by both interferon\\nβ-1a and ocrelizumab uncovered the presence of relentless pro-\\ngression even in a phase of the disease in which relapses usually\\ndominate. 4\\nOther factors associated with CDA, in particular the RR disease\\ncourse and lower EDSS score at baseline, were shared by both\\nRAW and PIRA and were consistent with well-acknowledged pre-\\ndictors of disability worsening in early multiple sclerosis.23\\nImportantly, a longer exposure to DMT was associated with a\\nlower risk of any CDA, independent of the phenotype. The efﬁ-\\ncacy of DMT on PIRA, in particular the superiority of ocrelizumab\\nover interferonβ-1a, has already been reported in the pooled ana-\\nlysis of OPERA-1 and OPERA-2 trials.4 While the prevention of\\nRAW is a straightforward outcome of inﬂammatory and relapse\\nactivity suppression, the effectiveness of DMT on PIRA also indi-\\ncates that‘silent’progression could be, at least in part, sustained\\nby an inﬂammatory component. It has to be noted that our study\\nis purely clinically grounded, and we cannot exclude that acute\\ninﬂammatory activity on MRI have contributed to PIRA. Indeed,\\nin the subgroup of patients in which MRI assessment close to\\nCDA was available, the proportion of true PIRA was reduced to\\n23.4% of observed CDA. However, even in this analysis, DMT\\nwas effective in reducing the risk of true PIRA, suggesting that\\ndisability worsening was still attributable to an ongoing inﬂam-\\nmatory activity.\\nIt has been argued that the same underlying process that causes\\nsilent progression could be responsible for SP multiple sclerosis\\nwhen the march of clinical worsening is more evident.2 Indeed, pa-\\ntients with PIRA were characterized by accelerated brain atrophy\\nover time,2 and PIRA has been proposed as a criterion to mark, on\\nTable 1 Characteristics of the study sample\\nFirst CDA\\nTotal n = 5169 RAWn = 922 PIRAn = 1427 No CDAn = 2820 P\\nAge at baseline, year, mean ± SD 31.8 ± 9.9 30.3 ± 9.8 34.0 ± 10.1 31.1 ± 9.6 RAW versus no CDA 0.033\\nPIRA versus no CDA <0.001\\nRAW versus PIRA <0.001\\nSex, femalen (%) 3503 (67.8) 645 (70.0) 956 (67.0) 1902 (67.4) 0.280\\nDisease course at baseline,n (%) 0.575\\nCIS 2082 (40.3) 373 (40.5) 590 (41.3) 1119 (39.7)\\nRR 3087 (59.7) 549 (59.5) 837 (58.7) 1701 (60.3)\\nDisease duration at baseline, year, mean ± SD 0.42 ± 0.27 0.42 ± 0.27 0.44 ± 0.28 0.41 ± 0.27 RAW versus no CDA 0.417\\nPIRA versus no CDA <0.001\\nRAW versus PIRA 0.313\\nEDSS at baseline, mean ± SD 1.7 ± 1.2 1.5 ± 1.1 1.6 ± 1.3 1.8 ± 1.2 RAW versus no CDA <0.001\\nPIRA versus no CDA <0.001\\nRAW versus PIRA 0.621\\nOnset topography,n (%) 0.082\\nUnifocal 4402 (85.2) 774 (83.9) 1198 (84.0) 2430 (86.2)\\nMultifocal 767 (14.8) 148 (16.1) 229 (16.0) 390 (13.8)\\nFollow-up duration, year, mean ± SD 11.5 ± 5.5 13.7 ± 6.5 12.7 ± 5.9 10.1 ± 4.5 RAW versus no CDA <0.001\\nPIRA versus no CDA <0.001\\nRAW versus PIRA 0.001\\nNumber of visits during follow-up, mean ± SD 15.4 ± 12.5 9.2 ± 8.8 11.1 ± 10.3 19.6 ± 13.0 RAW versus no CDA <0.001\\nPIRA versus no CDA <0.001\\nRAW versus PIRA <0.001\\nDMT during follow-up,n (%) 2911 (56.3) 141 (15.3) 326 (22.8) 2444 (86.7) <0.001\\nPercentage of follow-up spent on DMT, mean ± SD 46.4 ± 44.7 13.5 ± 33.0 18.8 ± 36.9 71.1 ± 35.6 RAW versus no CDA <0.001\\nPIRA versus no CDA <0.001\\nRAW versus PIRA 0.018\\nFinal EDSS, mean ± SD 2.5 ± 2.0 3.7 ± 2.2 3.7 ± 2.0 1.4 ± 1.0 RAW versus no CDA <0.001\\nPIRA versus no CDA <0.001\\nRAW versus PIRA 0.999\\nSP at follow-up,n (%) 322 (6.2) 130 (14.1) 184 (12.9) 8 (0.3) <0.001\\nAlgorithmic deﬁnition SP at follow-up,n (%) 840 (16.3) 249 (27.0) 591 (41.4) 0 (0.0) <0.001\\nSigniﬁcant P-values are highlighted in bold.\\nProgression in early multiple sclerosis BRAIN 2022: 145; 2796 –2805 | 2801\\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/145/8/2796/6553893 by guest on 12 August 2024\\n'),\n",

The neurologist deﬁnition identiﬁed\\nonly 322 (6.2%) SP patients, while the more objective deﬁnition, de-\\nrived from that proposed by Lorscheider and colleagues,10 identiﬁed\\n840 (16.3%) SP cases. Moreover, unexpectedly, in multivariable mod-\\nels, SP course according to the neurologist deﬁnition was mostly dri-\\nven by RAW events, while a higher proportion of PIRA was\\nassociated with a higher risk of SP according to the algorithmic def-\\ninition. These differences could be explained, at least in part, by the\\nselection of patients having theﬁrst visit within 1 year from disease\\nonset. It is possible that, in theﬁrst years of the disease, neurologists\\nmay be prone to misclassiﬁcation and feel hesitant to irreversibly\\nassign an SP course, signiﬁcantly narrowing the availability of\\neffective and approved DMT options.\\nIn our opinion, theseﬁndings are in line with the hypothesis of\\nmultiple sclerosis as a single disease entity, in which RAW and\\nPIRA can coexist since disease onset, both contributing to the ac-\\ncumulation of irreversible disability and the transition to the pro-\\ngressive phase. The exhaustion of compensatory mechanisms\\nand age-related neurodegeneration are likely to play a role in\\nthe onset of the formerly described‘amnesic phenomen’,24 i.e.\\nthe self-perpetuating accumulation of disability after a threshold\\nof irreversible disability has been reached, irrespective (amnesic)\\nof the prior clinical history of thedisease. Of note, in our sample,\\nbeyond the CDA event, older age at baseline, and a higher baseline\\nEDSS score were the main prognostic factors associated with a\\nhigher risk of transition to SP multiple sclerosis.

However, its\\nprognostic value for predicting disease worsening is still being debated.

To perform well, deep learning al-\\ngorithms need large cohorts of MS patients including the major clin-\\nical phenotypes to accurately model the disease course and obtain ro-\\nbust and reliable results. The Italian Neuroimaging Network Initiative\\n(INNI) promotes the construction and maintenance of a repository\\nwhere MRI, clinical, and neuropsychological data from MS patients\\nand healthy controls are collected from 4 Italian research centers with\\ninternationally recognized expertise in the MS field, with the main\\ngoal of improving the application of MRI to study MS and to define\\nnovel MRI biomarkers for monitoring disease course.24\\nThe aim of this study was to develop and apply a deep learning\\nalgorithm on a large multicenter cohort of patients collected from INNI\\nto predict disease worsening in MS patients from their baseline MRI\\nfeatures. Toward this goal, MS patients with a baseline MRI scan and\\na clinical and cognitive follow-up of at least 2 years were considered.\\nThe performance of the algorithm was then evaluated on an indepen-\\ndent test set and compared with that of 2 expert physicians.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nEthics Committee Approval\\nApproval was received from the local ethical standards commit-\\ntee of each participating center, and written informed consent was ob-\\ntained from all participants at the time of data acquisition.\\nSubjects\\nData from 373 MS patients,25 299 with relapsing-remitting (RR)\\nMS and 74 with progressive (P) MS, with a clinical follow-up of 2 years\\n(±0.5 years) were retrieved from the INNI online repository (https://\\ndatabase.inni-ms.org) from 4 centers identified as“A,”“ B,”“ C,” and\\n“D.” At the time of writing this article, INNI repository comprised\\nMRI, demographic, and clinical data from 1519 MS patients with the\\nmain clinical phenotypes and 828 healthy volunteers for a total of\\n2347 subjects and 4351 MRI examinations acquired at the 4 Italian pro-\\nmoting centers. The patients' baseline visits collected for this study were\\nacquired from year 2007 to 2020.\\nAll participants underwent a clinical and MRI assessment at\\nbaseline with rating of the EDSS score and cognitive impairment with\\nthe Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), assessed within 48 hours\\nfrom the baseline MRI acquisition. At follow-up (mean follow-up time,\\n2 ± 0.5 years), all patients underwent a clinical assessment with rating\\nof the EDSS, and a subgroup of 151 MS patients also had an evaluation\\nof the SDMT.\\nMRI Acquisitions\\nUsing 3.0 T scanners (centers A and D: Intera [or Ingenia] and\\nAchieva, respectively; Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands;\\ncenter B: Signa HDxt; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI; center C:\\nMagnetom Verio; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), the following images\\nwere retrieved from the INNI database for the purposes of this study:\\n(1) 2D or 3D T2-weighted scans acquired with axial (or sagittal) orienta-\\ntion and a slice thickness of 3 or 1 mm, pixel size of 1/C2 1 mm, repetition\\ntime ranging from 2500 to 5310 milliseconds, echo time from 80 to\\n330 milliseconds, flip angle of 90 or 150 degrees, and echo train length\\nfrom 4 to 128; (2) 3D T1-weighted scans (fast field echo, turbo field\\necho, inversion recovery fast spoiled gradient echo, or magnetization pre-\\npared rapid gradient echo) with axial or sagittal orientation and isotropic\\npixel size of 1/C2 1 /C2 1 mm; repetition time ranging from 6.988 to 25 mil-\\nliseconds and 1900 milliseconds; echo time from 2.85 to 4.6 milliseconds;\\ninversion time ranging from 650 (for inversion recovery fast spoiled gra-\\ndient echo sequences) to 1000 milliseconds (for fast field echo and mag-\\nnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequences); and flip angle of 8, 9,\\nor 30 degrees. From center A, we retrieved MRI data acquired from 2 dif-\\nferent 3.0 T scanners (Intera and Ingenia; Philips Medical Systems, Best,\\nthe Netherlands) with 2 different MRI protocols26; thus we identify them\\nas center A1 and A2.\\nImage Preprocessing\\nStandardized preprocessing is systematically performed on all\\nINNI MRI data, including a procedure for quality control. Several mea-\\nsures to guarantee the quality of data uploaded to the INNI repository\\nfor multicenter MS studies were already implemented and described\\nin a previous study.26 Moreover, all sagittal acquisitions were reoriented\\nto the axial plane, and for the 3D T1-weighted acquisitions, excessive\\nportions of the neck were removed. Three-dimensional T1-weighted\\nand T2-weighted sequences were aligned to a common space using lin-\\near brain image registration (FMRIB's Linear Image Registration\\nTool),27 and brain tissues were separated from nonbrain tissues on both\\nscans (Brain Extraction Tool).28 During this affine registration, the skull\\nimage is used to determine a volumetric scaling factor to normalize\\nbrain tissue volumes accounting for different head sizes.29 Normalized\\nbrain volume (NBV), normalized GM volume (NGMV), and normalized\\nWM volume (NWMV) were then measured from the 3D T1-weighted\\nimages using the FSL SIENAx software.30 Focal T2-hyperintense WM\\nlesions were manually identified and segmented by raters from each par-\\nticipating center with a relevant expertise in the identification of MS WM\\nlesions (at least 10 years of experience for each rater in each center).\\nThen, all the T2-hyperintense WM lesion masks were visually inspected\\nand edited, if necessary, by experts from the center A. As also reported\\nin a previous article describing the quality control procedures,26 this\\n2-step process allowed us to obtain accurate and reproducible WM le-\\nsion masks. Focal T2-hyperintense WM lesions were identified and\\nsegmented following the recently published recommendations.31\\nFor the purposes of this study, axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted\\nimages from each patient were registered to the MNI-152 atlas space32\\nusing just an affine transformation (FMRIB's Linear Image Registration\\nTool, FSL toolbox, version 5.0.5) to obtain comparable anatomical loca-\\ntions among patients while preserving their brain topology. Coregistered\\nT1-weighted and T2-weighted images in MNI space were the input for\\nthe implemented deep learning algorithm.\\nTraining and Testing Dataset\\nThe whole data set was separated into a training set and a test set,\\nas schematically shown in Figure 1. In the training set, 325 MS patients\\nacquired from centers A1, B, C, and D were included. The training set\\nwas used to adjust the weights of the model and to measure the perfor-\\nmance of the trained convolutional neural network (CNN) (the validation\\nstep) after each epoch. The test set consisted of 48 MS patients acquired\\nat center A2 and was selected to constitute an independent data set for\\nmodel evaluation, because MRIs for these patients were acquired on a\\ndifferent MR scanner in respect to the MRIs used for the training phase.\\nTo train the algorithm, a binary vector with the information on\\ndisease evolution for each patient was created (0 = stable patient;\\n1 = worsened patient). We classified patients as follows:\\n\\x81 Clinically worsened if their EDSS score increase at follow-up was\\n≥1.5 when baseline EDSS was 0,≥1.0 when EDSS at baseline was\\n<6.0, and≥0.5 when EDSS at baseline was≥6.0; and\\n\\x81 Cognitively worsened when there was an SDMT raw score change of\\nat least 4 points at follow-up.33\\nUsing these binary classifications, we trained and tested 3 differ-\\nent models according to clinical worsening (EDSS-based model), cog-\\nnitive worsening (SDMT -based model), or both (EDSS + SDMT–\\nbased model).\\nStorelli et al Investigative Radiology \\x81 Volume 57, Number 7, July 2022\\n424 www.investigativeradiology.com © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The\\nalgorithm was developed starting from a CNN architecture already im-\\nplemented in our previous study to perform classification among differ-\\nent WM diseases that can enter differential diagnosis with MS.22 We\\nmodified the network specifically for this study, reducing the number\\nof CNN blocks and hyperparameters of the model to be optimized.\\nMoreover, we did not use data augmentation, because the size of the\\ntraining sample was considered adequate.34 The inputs to the models\\nwere the intensity normalized T2-weighted and T1-weighted entire im-\\nages for each patient and a true class binary vector with the information\\non disease evolution (0 = stable; 1 = worsened) at 2 years. The output of\\nthe algorithm was a probability value for each patient of belonging to 1\\nof the 2 classes: MS stable or MS worsening. A schematic overview of\\nthe deep learning algorithm implemented is shown in Figure 2.\\nThe network architecture comprises a sequence of three 3D\\nconvolutional blocks with increasing number of filters (32, 64, and\\n128) and the same filter size of 3/C2 3 /C2 3 for each MR sequence\\n(T2-weighted and T1-weighted images), followed by a fully connected\\nlayer and a rectified linear unit activation function. This function forces\\nto zero any negative input value maintaining the nonlinearity of the\\nmodel, and is commonly used because it leads to efficient training on\\nlarge data sets. A max-pooling layer tailed a response normalization\\nfunction to reduce the dimensionality of the input representation and,\\nas a consequence, the computational cost. The final layer for each\\nblock consisted of a dropout function (dropout fraction = 0.2) as an ad-\\nditional regularization method to reduce overfitting and improve gen-\\neralizability. The previously described block is repeated 3 times for\\neach MR sequence, and their final outputs are then merged to take ad-\\nvantage from both image contrasts (T2-weighted and T1-weighted).\\nLastly, a fully connected dense layer was incorporated to associate ev-\\nery input to every output of each layer by a weight estimated with a lin-\\near activation function. On the basis of the previously obtained fea-\\ntures, the last layer performs the classification and outputs a scalar\\nprobability value, for each patient, of belonging to each of the classifi-\\ncation labels the model is trying to predict (stable or worsened).\\nGiven the fact that in our data set there was a class imbalance\\n(more stable than worsened MS patients), during the training phase,\\nwe introduced a“class-weight” in the error estimation to give a higher\\nweight to the underrepresented class. This parameter was set according\\nto the ratio between the number of patients in the stable and worsened\\ngroups. The model was trained for 150 epochs with the early stopping\\noption. To optimize feature representation throughout the training pro-\\ncess, we select a batch size of 32 and the learning rate was set to 0.001.\\nThe method was implemented in the Python programming lan-\\nguage (Release 2.7.15), using the Keras module for neural networks\\nwith Theano as a back end and a Tesla K40 GPU.\\nThe algorithm was trained to classify (1) clinical evolution\\n(based on EDSS change), and, for a subgroup of 151 MS patients, also\\n(2) cognitive evolution (based on SDMT score change) or (3) both.\\nFIGURE 1.Outline of the collected data set and how it was split into training and test sets for the optimization, validation, and test phases of the model.\\nThe sample size for each center is also reported.\\nInvestigative Radiology \\x81 Volume 57, Number 7, July 2022 Deep Learning in Multiple Sclerosis Prognosis\\n© 2022 W olters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Moreover, they worked on the predic-\\ntion of the exact EDSS score and not the“binary prognosis” (stable or\\nworsened) as in our proposed algorithm.42\\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a\\ndeep learning model on a multicenter cohort of MS patients to predict\\ndisease evolution at 2 years from baseline MRI scans. We also tested\\nits performance to predict clinical and/or cognitive worsening on an in-\\ndependent data set in comparison to physicians' expertise. We obtained\\ngood accuracy (80%) on the validation set for prognosis of clinical dis-\\nability (EDSS-based model) that increased (to 87%) when adding cog-\\nnitive information to train the algorithm. However, when using the cog-\\nnitive information alone during the training (SDMT -based model), we\\nobtained a lower accuracy of 71% in predicting cognitive worsening.\\nThis may be partly due to the lower sample size used when training\\nthe SDMT -based model compared with the EDSS-based model (only\\n151 of the 373 selected patients had a cognitive assessment after\\n2 years), thus leading to a less optimal network. In addition, we cannot\\nexclude that the analysis of other image contrasts, not included in our\\nstudy, such as double inversion recovery sequences, would have re-\\nsulted in better performance for the SDMT -based model, because sev-\\neral studies have found a correlation between cognitive deficits and\\nthe presence or volume of cortical lesions.46\\nConsidering the independent test set, the 3 prognostic models\\n(EDSS-based, SDMT -based, and EDSS + SDMT–based) confirmed\\nthe high accuracies, similar to those found for the validation set, and\\nthe same differences among them. Thus, the model proved to be robust\\nand generalizable enough to be used on other, previously unseen, MRI\\ndata sets. Moreover, for all models, the specificity was higher than the\\nsensitivity in the prognosis of clinical and cognitive worsening of these\\npatients. Multiple sclerosis patients with a negative prognosis (clinical\\nand/or cognitive worsening) were less often identified (57.1% to 75%\\nof disease worsened patients) by the proposed algorithm compared with\\nstable patients (82% to 90% of stable patients were correctly identified).\\nThis could be most probably due to the class imbalance between stable\\nand worsened MS patients in the input data set. However, it is important\\nto note that expert raters also showed poorer performance in identifying\\nclinically and/or cognitively worsened patients in comparison to stable\\nones. Multiple sclerosis is a very heterogeneous disease with different\\nclinical manifestations among patients and with unpredictable course\\nand evolution.1,47 Based on available prognostic data, it is likely that\\nthe inclusion of clinical information at baseline (other than EDSS)\\nwould have allowed a more comprehensive evaluation of disease prog-\\nnosis, at least for the expert raters. However, in this case, increasing in-\\nput variables would be required by the deep learning network with\\nlower versatility in practical use and higher computational cost. More\\ninput features often make a predictive artificial intelligence task more\\nchallenging to model and can have a negative impact on its fitting per-\\nformance.48 Another important aspect that should be considered, partic-\\nularly when addressing disability worsening, is the involvement of the\\nspinal cord, by examining both lesions and atrophy.3,49,50\\nOverall, disease prognosis assessed by human raters showed a\\ngood accuracy for both the training and test data sets (68% and 70%,\\nrespectively). Given the criteria on which visual assessment by the ex-\\npert raters was performed, these findings confirmed the prognostic\\nvalue of relatively simple MRI features, such as the number and loca-\\ntion of T2-hyperintense WM lesions and gross atrophy, as already dem-\\nonstrated by previous studies.4,9,10,50 In Figures 4 and 5, it is noticeable\\nhow some of these MRI markers at baseline (eg, infratentorial lesions,\\nbrain atrophy, etc) may also have been extracted by the deep learning\\nmodel as important features in its final decision on disease prognosis,\\nleading to correct or wrong classifications. For this reason, we applied\\nthe LRP method to perform at least a visual assessment of the salient\\nvoxels involved in the classification decisions of the CNN model. By\\na qualitative assessment, we found that WM lesions and periventricular\\nregions were highly relevant for the final classification of the algorithm,\\nconfirming the presence of brain atrophy and the lesion location as im-\\nportant MRI markers at baseline. However, the proposed artificial intelli-\\ngence model showed higher performance in comparison to the qualitative\\nprognostic evaluation made by the expert raters (higher accuracy, speci-\\nficity, and sensitivity). Indeed, deep learning algorithms may be able to\\nautomatically identify additional features or patterns characterizing the\\ndisease prognosis that are not visible by the expert radiologists or that\\nare still unknown. Therefore, there is still considerable ongoing research\\ninto this, because heatmap methods are limited. For example, heatmaps\\njust evidence voxels that contributed to the classification decision, but\\nthey do not offer an interpretation on the underlying reasons. Moreover,\\nthey strongly depend on the type of the network and should be read as an\\nindication on the locations that the specific classifiers emphasize.\\nThis study has some additional limitations that should be taken\\ninto account when interpreting our findings and when planning future\\nadvances. First, the model was trained to perform prognosis on the basis\\nof 2 brain MRI contrasts. However, as previously mentioned, the spinal\\ncord is an eloquent region for MS prognosis. Thus, the inclusion in the\\nmodel of spinal cord MR scans may well improve its performance, al-\\nthough high accuracy was achieved just using brain MRI data. More-\\nover, the inclusion of relevant demographic and clinical information\\nin the input features should be considered in future developments. Nev-\\nertheless, this study demonstrated that artificial intelligence techniques\\ncan reach high levels of accuracy in the prediction of disease evolution\\neven when using only MRI features to train the model. In our analyses,\\nwe did not apply any correction to compensate for the learning effect of\\nthe repeated SDMTs. However, in our study, SDMTevaluation was per-\\nformed for 151 MS patients at baseline visit as well as at the follow-up\\nvisit after 2 years. Because the follow-up time is longer than that consid-\\nered in previous studies that assessed test-retest reliability of SDMT,51\\nwe considered 2 years as an adequate interval to obtain negligible learn-\\ning effects on this test. Finally, given the small sample of patients that\\nshowed a worsening of both the EDSS and SDMT scores at follow-up\\n(2 patients of 48), a future validation on a larger cohort of patients with\\nthese clinical and cognitive impairments should be performed. How-\\never, good results were obtained even for the 2 models trained using\\nonly EDSS or SDMT information at baseline.\\nIn conclusion, we obtained a robust and accurate model for\\npredicting clinical and cognitive worsening of MS at 2 years, based\\non T1-weighted and T2-weighted brain MRI at baseline. This algorithm\\nhas the potential to be an important tool for supporting, rather than re-\\nplacing, physicians in their clinical routine for the prompt management\\nof MS patients at risk of disease worsening. Artificial intelligence could\\nbe an aid to clinicians in the difficult task of handling large amounts of\\ndata and understanding it (ie, extracting important features and pat-\\nterns), whereas conversely, the knowledge and expertise of clinicians\\nwould improve artificial intelligence performance. In the future, the\\ncapabilities of radiologists may be improved and broadened by\\nthese tools.\\nREFERENCES\\n1. Filippi M, Bar-Or A, Piehl F, et al.

We discuss its shortcomings and appraise the challenges of implementing\\nit in clinical settings, experimental trials, and research. The current deﬁnition of PIRA assumes\\nthat acute inﬂammation, which can manifest as a relapse, and neurodegeneration, manifesting as\\nprogressive disability accrual, can be disentangled by introducing speciﬁc time windows be-\\ntween the onset of relapses and the observed increase in disability. The term PIRMA (pro-\\ngression independent of relapse and MRI activity) was recently introduced to indicate disability\\naccrual in the absence of both clinical relapses and new brain and spinal cord MRI lesions.\\nAssessing PIRMA in clinical practice is highly challenging because it necessitates frequent\\nclinical assessments and brain and spinal cord MRI scans. PIRA is commonly assessed using\\nExpanded Disability Status Scale, a scale heavily weighted toward motor disability, whereas a\\nmore granular assessment of disability deterioration, including cognitive decline, using com-\\nposite measures or other tools, such as digital tools, would possess greater utility. Similarly,\\nusing PIRA as an outcome measure in randomized clinical trials is also challenging and requires\\nmethodological considerations. The underpinning pathobiology of disability accumulation,\\nthat is not associated with relapses, may encompass chronic active lesions (slowly expanding\\nlesions and paramagnetic rim lesions), cortical lesions, brain and spinal cord atrophy, partic-\\nularly in the gray matter, diﬀuse and focal microglial activation, persistent leptomeningeal\\nenhancement, and white matter tract damage. We propose to use PIRA to understand the main\\ndeterminant of disability accrual in observational, cohort studies, where regular MRI scans are\\nnot included, and introduce the term of“advanced-PIRMA”to investigate the contributions to\\ndisability accrual of the abovementioned processes, using conventional and advanced imaging.\\nThis is supported by the knowledge that MRI reﬂects the MS pathogenic mechanisms better\\nthan purely clinical descriptors. Any residual disability accrual, which remains unexplained after\\nconsidering all these mechanisms with imaging, will highlight future research priorities to help\\ncomplete our understanding of MS pathogenesis.\\nFrom the Queen Square MS Centre (O.C., F.B., A.E., A.T.T.), Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University\\nCollege London; National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) (O.C.), University College London Hospitals (UCLH) Biomedical Research Centre; Centre for Medical Image\\nComputing (F.B.), University College London, United Kingdom; Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine (F.B.), Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Neth-\\nerlands; Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences (M.C.), University of Verona; Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience (N.D.S.), University of\\nSiena; Neuroimaging Research Unit (M.F., M.A.R.), Division of Neuroscience, and Neurology Unit (M.F., M.A.R.), Neurorehabilitation Unit, Neurophysiology Service, IRCCS San\\nRaffaele Scientific Institute; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University (M.F., M.A.R.), Milan; Department of Neuroscience (C.

PIRA brings the concept of disability\\naccrual independent of relapses, considered to be exclusive to\\npatients with progressive MS,3 to the RRMS phenotype, even\\nin early MS4 and after theﬁrst demyelinating event.5 PIRA\\nappears to be the main driver of disability accumulation across\\nall MS phenotypes.1,6-8 We estimate that the proportion of\\npatients developing PIRA is 3%–4% per each year of follow-up\\n(Figure 1). The underlying mechanisms of PIRA are thought to\\nbe chronic inﬂammation and neurodegeneration, more pro-\\nnounced in progressive MS, but also present in relapsing MS.9\\nHerein, we discuss the challenges facing PIRA, from its clinical-\\nbased deﬁnition to its translation into clinical settings and trials,\\nand the likely biological underpinning PIRA, as assessed by\\nimaging. In response to calls to classify MS rooted in its\\nbiological mechanisms,10 we propose to evolve from a clinical-\\nbased deﬁnition of PIRA toward a comprehensive quantiﬁca-\\ntion of pathogenic mechanisms related to PIRA using MRI and\\nother paraclinical measures of underlying pathology. This\\ncommentary arises from the themes discussed at a Magnetic\\nResonance Imaging in MS (MAGNIMS) consortium work-\\nshop dedicated to PIRA, held in May 2023 in Verona, Italy.\\nShortcomings of PIRA Deﬁnition in\\nLight of MS Pathogenic Mechanisms\\nThe most recent, harmonized deﬁnition of PIRA8 recom-\\nmends the following principles for its assessment: (1) an in-\\ncreased disability score (or event score), commonly measured\\non the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), should be\\nrecorded at least 3 months after and 1 month before the onset\\nof an investigator-reported relapse; (2) a new baseline score\\nshould take place after each relapse; and (3) a conﬁrmation\\nscore should be assessed at least 3 months after the initial\\ndisability increase and 1 month before the onset of an\\ninvestigator-reported relapse (Figure 2).8\\nFigure 1Annual Frequency of PIRA Events Reported by Previous Studies\\nThis figure represents the percentage of people with MS who develop at least 1 PIRA event a year, as reported by previous studies.

The pathologic correlates\\nof relapses are acute inﬂammatory demyelinating lesions.9\\nBoth Wallerian degeneration of axons following transection in\\nacute lesions, and subsequent loss of chronically demyelinated\\naxons, contribute to postlesional neurodegeneration.11 In-\\nﬂammatory lesions and neurodegeneration are present at all\\nstages of MS.9 Although substrates for “primary” neuro-\\ndegeneration have been proposed,12 there is no robust evi-\\ndence for them. Longitudinal MRI studies have shown\\nongoing and sustained optic nerve atrophy 1 year after optic\\nneuritis, despite improved visual function. 13 Optical co-\\nherence tomography (OCT) has shown thinning of the ret-\\ninal ﬁber layer up to 6 months from acute optic neuritis.14\\nSimilarly, spinal cord atrophy occurs over 6 months after\\nacute myelitis, concurrent with clinical recovery.15 A sequence\\nof events, unfolding over at least 2 years, arising from white\\nmatter lesions to subsequent white matter damage and then\\ngray matter atrophy, has been demonstrated in progressive\\nMS using MRI.16 Therefore, it is credible that, at least in some\\ncases, the observed progression designated as PIRA could still\\nbe secondary to the preceding relapse, even when measured\\nlater than 3 months from relapse onset.\\nSecond, an interval of 1 month before a relapse may not be\\nappropriate to identify progression independent of that relapse.\\nMicrostructural MRI changes in the white matter of patients\\nwith MS are observed 3–18 months before acute lesions be-\\ncome visible on conventional MRI.17,18 These ﬁndings suggest\\nthat there may be inﬂammation-related neuronal damage, with\\nconsequent neurodegeneration, months before the clinical\\nonset of a subsequent relapse. Therefore, the time window\\nproposed for the deﬁnition of PIRA should be interpreted with\\ncaution.\\nThird, the development of asymptomatic brain MS lesions\\nconﬁrms that focal inﬂammatory demyelination does not al-\\nways manifest with an acute relapse. Although asymptomatic\\nspinal cord lesions are rarer than asymptomatic brain lesions,\\nthey are seen in relapsing MS.19,20 All subjects with a radio-\\nlogically isolated syndrome (RIS) who developed primary\\nprogressive MS during a 15-year follow-up possessed spinal\\ncord lesions at the time of the diagnosis of RIS,21 suggesting\\nthat disability accrual may be induced by concurrent,\\nasymptomatic inﬂammation, that may not be captured by the\\ncurrent deﬁnition of PIRA.8\\nTherefore, on current evidence, it is diﬃcult to justify a dis-\\nconnect between inﬂammatory demyelination (relapses) and\\nneurodegeneration (progression). It is possible that some\\nvariance in the observed disability accrual that deﬁnes PIRA\\ncould be linked to the preceding, concurrent, or impending\\ninﬂammation.\\nThe Limitations of Incorporating MRI\\nActivity Into PIRA\\nThe terms “true PIRA,”“ pure PIRA,” and “PIRMA” (pro-\\ngression independent of relapses and MRI activity) have been\\nproposed to add the absence of brain and spinal cord MRI\\nactivity (new T2 lesions and/or gadolinium [Gd] lesions)\\nbetween 3 months after and 1 month before the onset of a\\nrelapse.4,8 In a mildly aﬀected cohort of patients with MS,\\n30.8% of PIRA events were accompanied by MRI activity.22\\nThe inclusion of new brain T2 lesions and/or Gd lesions into\\nPIRA has reduced the number of PIRA events by half (from\\n47.9% to 23.4%),4 suggesting that asymptomatic brain lesions\\nmay be responsible for at least some PIRA events previously\\nreported. The use of PIRMA is an important step because it\\naligns the concept of PIRA to the deﬁnition of disease activity\\nin terms of both relapses and new brain lesions, commonly\\nadopted in clinical practice and MS research. It also aligns\\nPIRA to no evidence of disease activity, which also incorpo-\\nrates relapses and MRI activity.\\nHowever, the inclusion of new brain lesions into the PIRA\\ndeﬁnition (i.e., PIRMA) also requires deliberation. First,\\nasymptomatic spinal cord lesions occur between 15% and\\n25% of patients with RRMS without relapses,19,20 hence a\\nFigure 2Schematic Representation of PIRA\\nPIRA is the increase in disability of the event score\\n(most commonly EDSS) compared with baseline score.\\nAbsence of relapses is required between 90 days be-\\nfore and 30 days after the event score and at the time\\nof the confirmation score.

Importantly, lesion location may also be crucial, if\\naﬀecting an eloquent pathway. A single, cord lesion (or >1\\nlesion), critically situated in the corticospinal tract, may result\\nin asymmetric motor progression in MS with otherwise low\\nlesion burden (<5 lesions).23 This suggests that certain CNS\\nregions, such as cord, may be more relevant for progression in\\nMS than other regions or global injury. However, spinal cord\\nMRI is currently not mandatory for the monitoring of MS24\\nand technically challenging for the robust identiﬁcation of\\nlesions.\\nSecond, the occurrence of new brain lesions on conventional\\nMRI is only one of the inﬂammatory processes that may\\ncontribute to disability accrual in MS; other processes include\\nnot only asymptomatic spinal cord lesions19 but also chronic\\nactive lesions (e.g., paramagnetic rim lesions and slowly\\nexpanding lesions25) and cortical lesions26 (although these\\nappear less inﬂammatory than white matter lesions).\\nThird, a clinical relapse is the manifestation of a symptomatic\\nacute lesion, but an asymptomatic new MRI lesion could\\ntheoretically produce subclinical worsening, thereby leading\\nus to reconsider the concept of RAW because subclinical\\ndisability deterioration after an asymptomatic lesion may be\\nrelated to that new lesion. This would lead us to reconsider\\nwhat is meant by the term“relapse” and whether asymp-\\ntomatic lesions should be included under this term.27 The\\ndiﬀerences between RAW and PIRA may be simply due to the\\nintensity of the inﬂammatory process.\\nThe Challenges of Translating PIRA\\nInto Clinical Settings\\nThe use of PIRA remains limited to clinical trials and research\\n(including prospective, longitudinal cohorts) because the de-\\ntermination of PIRA in clinical practice is prohibitively chal-\\nlenging and necessitates regularly scheduled and standardized\\nclinical assessments and comprehensive MRI protocols. Several\\nparameters aﬀect the accuracy characteristics of PIRA.8 Robust\\nPIRA assessment requires a frequent number of visits, more\\nthan standard clinical care. A conﬁrmation score should be\\nrecorded at least 3 months after the event score, but preferably\\n6o r1 2m o n t h s .8 Relapses should be investigator-reported,\\nrather than patient-reported.8 Acute symptoms, which are not\\ncommonly recognized as relapses, such as predominant cog-\\nnitive impairment28 and fatigue, can occur, and disability ac-\\ncrual may be linked to these unconventional MS relapses. In\\naddition, the inclusion of all investigator-reported relapses\\n(instead of only EDSS-conﬁrmed or protocol-deﬁned relapses)\\nmay lead to fewer PIRA events. In addition, the duration of\\nfollow-up aﬀects the number of recorded PIRA events.\\nThere is an aspiration to broaden the deﬁnition of PIRA by\\nusing a composite outcome and include other clinical mani-\\nfestations of disability progression, such as cognitive decline,\\nupper and lower limb function and/or deterioration detected\\nby digital tools, and patient-reported outcome measures.\\nThese composites will likely increase the sensitivity of PIRA,\\nby encompassing patients who develop progression in do-\\nmains beyond EDSS, which is highly weighted toward motor\\ndisability, but they are likely to further limit its use in everyday\\npractice.\\nThe Limitations of PIRA as the End\\nPoint of Clinical Trials\\nSeveral studies have investigated the impact of disease-\\nmodifying treatments on PIRA as an outcome.6,29 These tri-\\nals showed that treatment beneﬁt was mostly explained by a\\nreduction in relapse activity and, consequently, RAW, and by\\nreducing development of new MRI lesions, which, in turn, may\\nlower the likelihood of PIRA in the long term. However, in the\\nshort-term, treatment trials would not signiﬁcantly slow down\\ndisability progression, possibly due to the eﬀects of existing\\nlesions, and PIRA should continue to be observed despite\\na reduction in relapse rate. A possible interpretation of this\\nﬁnding is that a treatment suppressing relapse activity, also\\nreduces disability associated with relapses, thereby making it\\nmore likely that any observed disability accrual is independent\\nof relapses.1 This hypothesis has been conﬁrmed by a recent\\nsimulation of a randomized controlled trial (personal com-\\nmunication at ECTRIMS 2023) showing that the placebo arm\\nhas fewer PIRA events than the treatment arm because it is\\nmore likely that EDSS increases are associated with relapses\\nthat are more numerous in the placebo arm than in the treat-\\nment arm. Therefore, a treatment with high eﬃcacy on relapses\\nmay artiﬁcially increase the number of PIRA events compared\\nwith placebo,29 and accurate detection of all RAW events, made\\npossible with appropriate visit timings, is necessary if PIRA is to\\nbe used as a primary end point.\\nA methodological challenge for PIRA assessment in clinical\\ntrials is that baseline EDSS at study entry is likely to reduce over\\ntime because of (1) regression to the mean and (2) patients\\nwho are enrolled after an acute event may improve over time. A\\nroving baseline, which has been recommended,8 cannot be\\nused in randomized clinical trials because a postrandomization\\nevent cannot be used as reference value because of possible\\ntreatment inﬂuence. This consideration suggests that assessing\\ntreatment eﬀects on PIRA in randomized clinical trials remains\\nchallenging, although not impossible with careful planning and\\nadapted statistical methodology.\\nAdvanced-PIRMA to Understand\\nDisability Accrual in\\nMultiple Sclerosis\\nThe mechanisms of disability accrual not associated with\\nrelapses in RRMS and captured by advanced MRI\\nNeurology | Volume 103, Number 1 | July 9, 2024 Neurology.org/N\\ne209444(4)\\nDownloaded from https://www.neurology.org by Universit degli Studi di Bologna on 21 August 2024\\n'),\n",

In addition, genetic\\nvariants (a genetic determinant of MS severity has recently\\nbeen discovered39)a n dp r oﬁles of speciﬁc proteins, such\\nas those related to the arachidonic acid-derived lipid me-\\ndiators, 40 are associated with neurodegenerative processes\\nthat contribute to disease progression. A corollary of\\nadvanced-PIRMA is that detectable residual disability ac-\\ncrual, unexplained after considering all these underlying\\nmechanisms, could highlight crucial unmet areas of future\\nresearch in MS pathobiology.\\nConclusion and Future Directions\\nPIRA has been informative in alerting clinicians to the notion\\nthat progressive disability accrual occurs across the full spec-\\ntrum of MS, similar to previous MRIﬁndings of development\\nof brain atrophy in the early stages of MS. However, the\\ninterpretation of PIRA as a measure speciﬁc to disease pro-\\ngression independent of inﬂammation cannot fully represent\\nthe underlying mechanisms of the disease.\\nThe inclusion of new brain lesions in the PIRA framework\\n(i.e., PIRMA) is an important step that aligns it with other\\nclinical end points but does not address certain fundamental\\nshortcomings: (1) disability worsening may continue for\\nmore than 3 months after a relapse and (2) inﬂammatory\\nprocesses other than brain T2/Gd lesions (i.e., asymptomatic\\nspinal cord lesions, chronic active lesions) or those not\\ndetected by MRI may contribute to the accumulation of dis-\\nability in MS.\\nA more accurate assessment of clinical deterioration,\\nbeyond EDSS (e.g., composite outcomes or digital bio-\\nmarkers), which includes cognitive decline and patient-\\nreported outcome measures, is necessary. However, this\\nwill make PIRMA assessment even more complex. More\\nconsideration should be given to the use of PIRMA as an\\nend point in clinical trials and the consequences for their\\ndesign and statistical analysis.\\nAdvanced-PIRMA can be applied to understanding the con-\\ntributions of pathogenic processes studied with imaging (e.g.,\\nnew brain and spinal cord lesions, SELs, PRLs, intracortical\\nlesions, total brain, spinal cord and gray matter atrophy, lep-\\ntomeningeal enhancement, diﬀuse microglia activation),ﬂuid\\nbiomarkers, OCT, genetic variants, and proteomics toward\\ndisability accrual. Any extant disability progression un-\\nexplained by these processes could help focus future research\\ndirections.\\nOur improved understanding of mechanisms of progression\\nand the known relationship between inﬂammation and neu-\\nrodegeneration highlight the need to move from a clinical-\\nbased deﬁnition of PIRA toward a more biologically focused\\nFigure 4 Examples of Brain Atrophy, Slowly Expanding Lesions, Spinal Cord Segmentation, Cortical Lesions, and Lep-\\ntomeningeal Enhancement\\n(A) Axial T1-weighted images acquired between 1995 (first image on the left) and 2005 (last image on the right) showing progressing development of brain\\natrophy (increase size of the ventricles and widening cortical sulci) and slowly expanding lesions (yellow arrows).

Cognitive impairment is a sometimes neglected, \\nyet common, sign and symptom with a profound effect on instrumental activities of daily living. The prevalence of \\ncognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis varies across the lifespan and might be difficult to distinguish from other \\ncauses in older age. MRI studies show that widespread changes to brain networks contribute to cognitive dysfunction, \\nand grey matter atrophy is an early sign of potential future cognitive decline. Neuropsychological research suggests \\nthat cognitive processing speed and episodic memory are the most frequently affected cognitive domains. Narrowing \\nevaluation to these core areas permits brief, routine assessment in the clinical setting. Owing to its brevity, reliability, \\nand sensitivity, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, or its computer-based analogues, can be used to monitor episodes of \\nacute disease activity. The Symbol Digit Modalities Test can also be used in clinical trials, and data increasingly show \\nthat cognitive processing speed and memory are amenable to cognitive training interventions.\\nIntroduction \\nMultiple sclerosis is an inflammatory, demyelinating \\ndisease of the CNS, with neurodegeneration being \\nmost prominent in progressive phenotypes. The course \\nof mul  tiple sclerosis varies widely. S ome patients have \\na single episode or attack, called a clinically isolated \\nsyndrome or a radiologically isolated syndrome, depend\\xad\\ning on whether the disease manifests clinically or on \\nMRI. Patients with multiple CNS lesions or neurological \\nsigns that are separated in time are diagnosed with \\nrelapsing\\xadremitting multiple sclerosis. A progressive \\ncourse refers to accumulating or worsening of neuro\\xad\\nlogical disability, inde  pendent of relapses. Cognitive  \\nimpairment can develop insidiously and progress gradu\\xad\\nally, or decline abruptly during relapses, although this \\nrapid decline has been documented only in the past \\nfew years.\\nIn this Review, we endeavour to provide a concise and \\nup\\xadto\\xaddate perspective of multiple sclerosis \\xadassociated \\ncognitive impairment. We point out that cognitive def\\xad\\nicits can arise in isolation from other neurological signs \\nand, when present, are associated with increased risk of \\nfuture neurological disability. We aim to garner apprecia\\xad\\ntion of how cognitive impairment presents throughout \\nthe life  span, posing unique challenges to the clinical \\nmanage ment of paediatric (ie, <18 years) and older \\npatients (ie, >50 years). Easily administered and sensitive \\ntests of cognitive processing speed (CPS) and memory \\nare now available to neurologists. The results of these \\ntests are associated with \\nmultiple MRI indices of cere  \\xad\\nbral disease, including chronic white matter demye\\xad\\nlination, acute inflammatory changes, and grey matter \\natrophy. These tests can be applied routinely to screen \\nfor cognitive impairment, monitor disease activity, \\nand assess the effects of treatment. Some restorative and \\ncom  pensatory interventions for cognitive rehabilita\\xad\\ntion seem to be beneficial. Additional randomised \\ncontrolled trials with cognition as the primary endpoint are needed to investigate the effects of disease\\xadmodifying \\ntherapies on cognition.\\nPrevalence, cognitive profile, and phenotypes \\nCognitive deficits can occur in the early stages of multiple \\nsclerosis, even in the absence of other neurological \\ndeficits.\\n1,2 The convention in neuropsychology is to ascribe \\ncognitive impairment to a score where performance falls \\nless than 1·5 SD below normative expectation, after accounting for demo graphics such as age and education. \\nIn diagnosing cognitive impair  ment, clinicians should \\naccount for psychiatric comorbidities, medication side \\xad\\neffects, and multiple sclerosis symptoms that might \\nadversely affect cognitive performance. In two large \\nseminal studies, patients were categorised as having cogni tive impairment if their performance was impaired \\non four of 31 tests 3 or two of 11 tests 4 in a multidomain \\nneuropsychological test battery. By these, or similar, \\nstandards for designating impairment, the prevalence of cog nitive impairment in adults with multiple sclerosis \\nranges from 34% to 65%, varying by research setting and \\ndisease course.\\n5–8\\nLike all symptoms of multiple sclerosis, cognitive \\nimpairment is characterised by high variability between \\npatients. When results are taken together for a group \\nof people with multiple sclerosis,\\n3,4 CPS, learning, and \\nmemory are most frequently involved. Deficits in executive \\nfunction and visuospatial processing are also reported, \\nbut less frequently. 3,4 In particular, in a representative \\nsample of 291 adult patients with any type of multiple \\nsclerosis,\\n4 the fre  quencies of impairments (varying by \\ntest) were as follows: 27–51% in CPS, 54–56% in visual \\nmemory, 29–34% in verbal memory, 15–28% in executive \\nfunction, and 22% in visuospatial processing. Basic \\nlanguage, semantic memory, and attention span are rarely \\nimpaired (in about 10% of patients with multiple scler\\xad\\nosis).\\n3,4 However, some studies suggest that semantic \\nfluency is more often com  promised than was previously \\nthought, especially in patients older than 50 years.9,10\\nCognitive impairment occurs in all multiple sclerosis \\nphenotypes:5,11 estimates are 20–25% of patients with \\nclinically isolated syndrome and radiologically isolated \\nsyndrome, 30–45% of patients with relapsing \\xadremitting '),\n",

Prevalence in primary \\nprogressive disease varies greatly, as this phenotype \\ncomprises less than 10% of the overall disease population \\nand study samples are small. In patients with radiologically \\nisolated syndrome, in which MRI findings sugges  tive \\nof multiple sclerosis are incidentally found in an asymp\\xad\\ntomatic individual,12 cognitive defects can pre \\xaddate the \\nappearance of other neurological symptoms and signs  \\nand are associated with CNS lesions seen on MRI. 6 In a \\nprospective study based on the Norwegian Conscript Service \\ndatabase, male participants who later developed multiple \\nsclerosis showed significantly lower intelligence quotients \\nthan did healthy controls at ages 18–19 years, several years \\nbefore their first symptoms.13 Patients with clinically iso\\xad\\nlated syndrome or relapsing \\xadremitting mul tiple sclerosis \\nshow similar neuropsychological pro files with prominent \\ninvolvement of CPS, whereas in pro  gressive forms of \\nthe disease, impaired memory and executive function are \\nmore common.5,14\\nThe so\\xadcalled benign form of multiple sclerosis merits \\ndiscussion. Patients with benign multiple sclerosis, which \\nis defined by an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) \\nscore of less than 3·0 after at least 15 years since disease \\nonset, can present with cognitive impairment despite \\npreservation of motor and other neurological functions.  \\nIn a longitudinal study, patients with benign multiple \\nsclerosis and cognitive impairment were more likely to \\nhave clinical progression on the basis of EDSS scores (ie, \\nno longer benign status) at follow \\xadup after 5 years 15 and \\n12 years16 than were patients with multiple sclerosis who \\nhad preserved cognition. These results reinforce the \\nnotion that cognitive impairment can be an early \\nmanifestation of the disease, leading to the recom\\xad\\nmendation that preserved cognitive functioning is an \\nadditional requisite for disease course type.17\\nPaediatric\\xadonset (ie, younger than 18 years at onset) \\nmultiple sclerosis  represents 2–10% of the disease popula\\xad\\ntion, and not only CPS and memory but also verbal \\nintelligence can be affected. 18 Decreased intelli  gence \\nquotient and academic skills in comparison with healthy \\ncontrols have been noted in several studies,19 suggest ing \\nthe need for neuropsychological evalua  tion, special \\neducation, or other remedial interventions (panel 1). The \\nfew longitudinal studies of cognition in people with  \\npaediatric\\xadonset multiple sclerosis have yielded incon\\xad\\nsistent results because of varying study lengths, time \\nbetween assessments, and outcome measures. Some \\nstudies have shown little change in cogni  tion,20 whereas \\nother studies have shown that up to 56% of tested patients \\ndeclined on a general cognitive composite score.21 In \\na 1 \\xadyear Canadian study of 28 patients, 22 relative to \\n26 age\\xadmatched healthy controls, patients with paediatric\\xad\\nonset multiple sclerosis showed reduced age \\xadexpected \\ngains. In a population \\xadbased longitudinal cohort of \\n5704 adults with multiple sclerosis in Sweden, 7 CPS \\ndeclined faster in patients with paediatric \\xadonset multiple \\nsclerosis compared with patients with adult onset. Notably, \\npatients with paediatric \\xadonset multiple sclerosis tend to \\naccrue physical disability more slowly than their counter\\xad\\nparts with adult onset, despite physical disability com\\xad\\nmencing at a younger age.23 Therefore, patients with \\npaediatric\\xadonset multiple sclerosis might have cognitive \\nproblems that are out of proportion to physical disability.\\nTaken as a whole, these results emphasise the chal\\xad\\nlenging diagnostic dilemmas and deleterious long \\xadterm \\nconsequences of early onset of multiple sclerosis. Cerebral \\ndamage during the formative years not only might deprive \\npatients of educational and vocational opportunities, \\nbut also can disrupt normal neuronal maturation and \\naccrual of cognitive reserve that might buffer the effects of \\ndemyelination and atrophy later in life.\\nAt the other end of the lifespan, clinicians can be con\\xad\\nfronted with a differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis\\xad\\nassociated cognitive impairment versus age \\xadassociated \\nPanel 1: Paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis: dissociation \\nbetween physical and cognitive impairment\\nA 15-year-old white girl, with 9 years of education, was \\ndiagnosed with multiple sclerosis at age 13 years. Symptoms \\nat onset were dysaesthesias in the territory of the right \\ntrigeminal nerve. The patient was treated with intramuscular \\ninterferon beta 1a but clinical symptoms and activity on MRI \\npersisted, so she was switched to natalizumab at age 18 years, \\nwhich resulted in complete clinical and MRI stability \\n(Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 1·5).\\n6 months after diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and during \\ntreatment with interferon beta 1a, psychiatric interview \\nshowed that the patient had low self-esteem and difficulties \\nwith social integration. School attendance varied because of \\nthe fluctuating multiple sclerosis symptoms, and school \\nperformance was poor. The patient had no physical disability \\nat this time.\\nAt first presentation with symptoms of multiple sclerosis at \\nage 13 years, neuropsychological testing showed impaired \\nprocessing speed on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, impaired \\nmemory, and impaired linguistic skills in terms of verbal \\nfluency. After 1 year on natalizumab, repeat neuropsychological \\ntesting was stable with some improvement on the Symbol \\nDigit Modalities Test.

The diagnosis is particularly \\nimportant because some treatments, such as acetyl\\xad\\ncholinesterase inhibitors, are indicated for people with \\nAlzheimer’s disease,24 but not for those with multiple \\nsclerosis.25 Some evidence suggests that the cognitive \\nprofile of patients with multiple sclerosis older than \\n50 years does not differ from that of the general popula\\xad\\ntion with multiple sclerosis, although Jakimovski and \\ncolleagues9 reported that patients older than 50 years \\n(mean age 62 ·1 years [SD 6·3]) had impairments on a \\nsemantic fluency test, as frequently observed in patients \\nwith Alzheimer’s disease. Neuropsychological testing that \\nincludes comprehensive language assessment and radio\\xad\\nlogical testing that is more specific to other causes \\nof cognitive impairment other than multiple sclerosis \\n(eg, amyloid PET) might be needed in evaluating older \\npatients (ie, older than 50 years) with multiple sclerosis \\n(panel 2). Vascular cognitive impairment is characterised \\nby lacunes and widespread ischaemic white matter lesions, \\naffecting CPS and executive function.26 This char acterisa\\xad\\ntion is particularly relevant considering that vascu  lar \\ncomor bidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyper\\xad\\nlipi daemia have been increasingly reported in people \\nwith multiple sclerosis.27 In sum, for older patients, the \\ndifferential diagnosis of cognitive impairment due to \\nmultiple sclerosis from that of Alzheimer’s disease, \\nvascular dementia, and related disorder requires a compre\\xad\\nhensive analysis of cognitive profile and advanced imaging.\\nMRI assessment \\nEarly MRI studies showed that the extent of white matter \\nabnormalities visible on T2 \\xadweighted MRI did not fully \\nexplain the severity of cognitive impairment in patients \\nwith multiple sclerosis.28 Subsequent attempts to visual\\xad\\nise more subtle damage, by use of more advanced MRI \\ntechniques, such as magnetisation transfer, diffu  sion \\ntensor imaging, and T1 relaxometry, indicated wide\\xad\\nspread damage to brain tissue that appeared normal on \\nconventional T1\\xadweighted or T2\\xadweighted MRI.29–32 Other \\nimprovements in MRI technology included double \\ninversion recovery, providing visualisation of cortical \\nlesions,33 which were robustly correlated with cognitive \\ndecline.34\\nOf volumetric measures, grey matter volume correlated  \\nwith cognitive performance in several studies focusing \\non the deep grey matter,35 mesial temporal cortex, 36 and \\nneocortex.37 The clinical significance of damage to deep \\ngrey matter structures was further established by studying \\natrophy38 and diffusivity changes of the thalamus,39 which \\nwere both independently correlated with cognitive impair\\xad\\nment. Besides the thalamus and the cortical grey matter, \\nhippocampal volume40 and function 41 are altered in \\npatients with multiple sclerosis, and the hippocampus is a \\npre dilection site for demyelinated lesions.42\\nIn addition to structural damage, studies have increas\\xad\\ningly focused on the functional connectivity of grey matter \\nstructures, such as the thalamus, hippocampus, and \\ncerebral cortex, by use of resting state functional MRI. \\nThese studies noted altered connectivity patterns in \\npatients with multiple sclerosis who had cognitive impair\\xad\\nment.43,44 Although the dynamics found in patients with \\nmultiple sclerosis who have cognitive impairment differ \\nfrom those of healthy controls without multiple sclerosis, \\nthe direction of the relationship is inconsistent: increased \\nfunctional connectivity is noted in some studies,45 and \\ndecreased connectivity in others. 46 Early in the disease, \\nincreased connectivity can signify that neuronal resources \\nare compensating for demyelina  tion and neuronal loss. \\nLater, once these reserve resources are exhausted, con\\xad\\nnectivity diminishes, and cognitive impairment is more \\napparent. Overall, these network functional MRI studies \\nindicate that cognitive decline is explained by an accruing \\ndestabilisation of the brain network physiology.

The white matter \\nlesions and diffuse damage, as well as the grey matter \\nlesions and atrophy, together lead to the variable symp\\xad\\ntoms of cognitive impairment in patients with multiple \\nsclerosis. Combined structural and functional imaging \\nmeasures provide an explana  tion for the observed clini\\xad\\ncal heterogeneity.47 At this point, prediction of cognitive \\ndecline in individual patients is difficult on the basis \\nof MRI alone. Of the MRI measures that have been investi\\xad\\ngated, grey matter atrophy seems to be the most reliable \\nmarker and patients with more severe structural damage \\nat baseline are at greatest risk for future cognitive impair\\xad\\nment.48 When such atrophy is readily apparent, this could \\nalert clinicians to the need for further investigation  of a \\npatient’s cognitive status, to identify people at risk for \\nemployment loss or in need of cognitive rehabilitation.\\nCognitive assessment \\nClinical neuropsychologists have abandoned lengthy, \\ncomprehensive test batteries for patients with multiple \\nsclerosis, in favour of more targeted, sensitive tests, such \\nas the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT).49 The SDMT \\npresents a symbol–digit pairing key at the top of a page \\nand a series of symbols below, each with a blank space \\nunderneath. For 90 s, the examinee orally indicates the \\nmatching number associated with a random array of \\nsymbols, as rapidly as possible. Originally administered in \\na written response format, followed by an oral response, \\nRao50 abandoned the written format to avoid the potential \\nconfounders of upper extremity weakness and ataxia. The \\noral response SDMT has since become the gold standard \\nfor assessing cognition in patients with multiple scler\\xad\\nosis.51,52 Benedict and colleagues 53 further developed the \\ntest by establishing equivalent, alternate forms to mitigate \\nthe effects of associative memory. As noted previously,51,54 \\nthe SDMT is sensitive but non \\xadspecific. The test empha\\xad\\nsises processing speed, but a patient’s performance also \\ndepends to some extent on other functions, such as \\nworking memory, paired \\xadassociate learning, and visual \\nscanning. The more complex a task, the more likely it is to \\nbe sensitive to change and cerebral pathology, and this \\nsensitivity might partly explain the importance of the \\nSDMT in clinical and research applications (for a historical \\nperspective see Benedict and colleagues).51\\nEpisodic memory tests emphasising learning over \\nsuccessive trials, followed by a measure of retention or \\ndelayed recall after 20–30 min, are a mainstay of clinical \\nneuropsychology. On the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning \\nTest (RA VLT),55 the examiner reads a list of 15 words and \\nasks the patient to recall as many words as possible. There \\nare five learning trials followed by a delayed recall task, in \\nwhich the patient recalls the same information without \\nanother exposure to the word list. Another frequently used \\nverbal memory test, the California Verbal Learning Test \\n(CVLT),56 also discriminates cognitive impairment in \\npatients with multiple sclerosis from otherwise healthy \\ncontrols. A visual memory test called the Brief Visuospatial \\nMemory Test Revised (BVMTR)57 presents a 2  × 3 matrix \\nof six figures for 10 s. Visual learning is assessed by \\nthe rendering of the figures after exposure and, as in the \\nRA VLT or CVLT, patients are asked to retain the same \\ninformation over 20–30 min. These memory tests \\n(ie, RA VLT, CVLT, and BVMTR) are nearly as effective as \\nthe SDMT at distinguishing cognitive impairment in \\npatients with multiple sclerosis from otherwise healthy \\nindividuals. In a syste  matic review, effect size for dis\\xad\\ntinguishing cognitive impairment in people with multiple \\nsclerosis from otherwise healthy controls (Cohen’s d) was \\nreported as 1·1 for SDMT, 1·0 for BVMTR, and 0·9 for \\nCVLT.51 Patients with multiple sclerosis rarely show \\nevidence of rapid forgetting on these memory tests, unlike \\npatients with Alzheimer’s disease, in whom rapid for\\xad\\ngetting of learned information is a hallmark. Rather, in \\nmul tiple sclerosis, the initial learning most clearly \\ndiscriminates patients from healthy controls. 58 Conse\\xad\\nquently, only the learning trials of the CVLT and BVMTR \\nwere recommended for routine use in mul  tiple sclerosis \\nclinics.52 Importantly, neuropsycho  logical test batteries \\nemphasising CPS and memory correlate  with employ\\xad\\nability59 and other activities of daily living.60\\nTwo consensus conference initiatives recommended  \\noptimal brief assessment batteries for multiple sclerosis: \\nthe Multiple Sclerosis Outcomes Assessment Consortium \\n(MSOAC)61 and the Brief International Cognitive \\nAssessment for Multiple Sclerosis  (BICAMS).52 The \\nFigure 1: SDMT decline and recovery curves in patients with cognitive relapse\\nChange from baseline in the difference between relapsing (defined by clinical diagnosis of gadolinium \\nenhancement on MRI) patients and stable patients in raw SDMT score.

Some of these tests yield data that are \\nsimilar whether or not a technician is present.68\\nMonitoring cognitive function in the clinical \\nsetting \\nMany patients with multiple sclerosis have progressive \\ncognitive decline due to neurodegeneration. 69 Gradual \\nslowing on CPS tests such as the SDMT 70 is related to a \\nloss of grey matter volume (eg, thalamic atrophy)71 and is \\npartly mitigated by the effects of cognitive reserve. 72,73 \\nMonitoring for progressing cognitive dysfunction is, \\ntherefore, one goal for screening in clinical settings.\\nCognitive deficits are also a sign of acute disease activity. \\nRelapses are defined as new or worsening neurological \\nsigns or symptoms lasting longer than 24 h, in the absence \\nof fever or infection.74,75 Relapses are commonly treated \\nby use of a short course of corticosteroid therapy at a \\nhigh dose, oral or intravenous methylprednisolone,76 \\nprednisone, or adrenocorticotropic hormone.77,78 Relapses \\nare typically diagnosed by sensory signs and physical \\nmanifestations via neuro  logi cal examination. Early case \\nreports and uncontrolled observational studies 79–82 sug\\xad\\ngested that acute changes in cognition could signify a \\nrelapse. However, these studies either did not control for \\ncognitive level before the relapse or did not include a \\ncomparison group to control for practice effects.\\nMorrow and colleagues 83 evaluated monthly SDMT \\nvalues used to screen for progressive multifocal leuko\\xad\\nencephalopathy in the STRATA study of patients receiving \\nnatalizumab for multiple sclerosis. The analysis showed \\na transient decline during relapses, followed by partial \\nrecov ery. However, the specific neurological deficits \\nshown by the patients who relapsed were not described, \\nand it is certainly possible that impairments that could \\naffect cogni tive performance, such as optic neuritis, severe \\nataxia, upper extremity paresis, or other signs, might have \\naffected the results. Benedict and colleagues 84 studied  \\npatients who were having a relapse and who had  symp\\xad\\ntoms and signs of cognitive impairment by self \\xadreport,  \\ninformant\\xadreport, or clinician impression. Patients with \\noptic neuritis, upper extremity paresis, severe ataxia, or \\nspinal cord signs that might compromise cognitive testing \\nwere excluded.

Preliminary work has suggested that this \\nrelationship might well exist. Brain HQ showed greater \\nbenefit on SDMT in patients with multiple sclerosis \\nwho had a high cognitive reserve, low disruption of \\nwhite matter tracts, and functional MRI profiles of con\\xad\\nnectivity that appeared closest to those of people without \\nmultiple sclerois.114\\nStrategy\\xadbased compensatory approaches emphasise \\nmanualised behavioural therapy that is administered by a \\ntherapist for individuals or groups. The modified Story \\nMemory Technique was the first compensatory approach \\nto be published, providing class I evidence for efficacy.106 \\nThe modified Story Memory Technique trains patients \\nto use context and imagery as strategies to improve \\nthe retention of information, up to 6 months post \\xad\\ntreatment.106 After 5 weeks of training, relative to placebo, \\npatients with memory impairment (n=86) recalled signi\\xad\\nficantly more words over five learning trials on the CVLT \\n(ie, a moderate to large effect), which was the primary \\nendpoint in the study. Self \\xadreported and family \\xadreported \\neveryday functioning, the secondary endpoint, also \\nshowed improvements. This treatment effect was \\nassociated with increased brain activation and functional \\nconnectivity in areas associated with learning and \\nmemory.115,116\\nExamples of other strategy \\xadbased approaches include \\nmental imagery, musical mnemonics, goal attainment \\ntraining, and general compensatory strategies (table). \\nDespite the increased degree and breadth of cognitive \\nimpairment in patients with progressive forms of mul tiple \\nsclerosis, most rehabilitation studies have focused on \\nrelapsing\\xadremitting multiple sclerosis. Studies suggest \\nthat both restorative102 and com pensatory117 approaches are \\nalso useful in treating cognitive impair ment in people with \\na progressive course, although these studies are scarce and \\nthere are exceptions.118 As patients with progressive disease \\nhave less cognitive reserve and grey matter volume, they \\nmight be less able to benefit from a restorative approach \\nthan patients with relapsing\\xadremitting multiple sclerosis. \\nThe promis ing results of cognitive retraining in patients \\nwith mul  tiple sclerosis provide an opportunity for an \\nimproved understanding of the underlying mechanisms \\nassociated with treatment response, which should be \\ninvestigated further in future research.\\nSome investigators are combining cognitive rehabi\\xad\\nlitation with other interventions to maximise effects, such \\nas cognitive behavioural therapy,118 transcranial direct cur\\xad\\nrent stimulation,119 and aerobic exercise.120 These combined  \\napproaches, although promising, require further research \\nbefore they are ready for clinical practice.\\nAs a single \\xadmodality intervention, exercise training \\nwould seem a viable approach in patients with multiple \\nscler osis, considering the cognitive benefits of aerobic \\nfitness, physical activity, and exercise in healthy older \\nadults. Motl and colleagues121 have called for randomised \\ncontrolled trials in patients with multiple sclerosis that \\nadopt the same interventions that were shown to be \\nsuccessful in the gerontology literature. Although there is \\nsome pre  liminary evidence that aerobic, resistance, \\nbalance, and other modes of exercise training might \\nimprove cognition, in multiple sclerosis, this conclusion \\nseems premature. A 2011 system atic review by Motl and  \\ncolleagues121 examined cognitive outcomes and noted \\nconflicting evidence and metho  dological concerns, such \\nas studies were not designed specifically to improve \\ncognition, inadequate statistical power, and an absence of \\ntransferability to quality of life outcomes. Notably, studies \\nthat did include cognition as a primary outcome often \\nshowed a beneficial effect on cognition, whereas those \\nthat did not include cognition as a primary outcome often \\nreported negative or no effects. A 2016 update to this \\nreview reported mostly positive findings.120 However, none \\nof the 21 new studies in the update recruited patients with \\ncognitive impairment a priori. Yet 16 of 21 (76%) studies  \\nwere randomised controlled trials, most of which used \\nneuropsychological tests as the primary outcome. Taken \\ntogether, these findings suggest that claims that exercise \\ntraining can be used to treat cognitive impairment in \\npatients with multiple sclerosis are premature.\\nFuture directions for research into exercise and cogni\\xad\\ntion should include examining the effects of interventions \\nthat might improve cognition on brain activity via neuro\\xad\\nimaging. For example, in a pilot investigation of the \\neffects of 12 weeks of supervised, progressive exercise \\ntraining for walking on a treadmill, the investigators \\nassessed verbal learning and memory in eight ambulatory \\npatients with multiple sclerosis and investigated the \\ntreatment’s effect on the hippocampus by use of advanced \\nneuro imaging (eg, mag  netic resonance elastography). 122 \\nResults showed that exercise training improved learning \\nand memory, and that this improvement was strongly \\nassociated with hippocampal activity.\\nConclusions and future directions \\nCognitive impairment is no longer regarded as a rare or \\npoorly measured sign in patients with multiple sclerosis. \\nEasily applied and sensitive tests, such as the SDMT, make \\ncognitive appraisal accessible in neurology clinics and \\nphase 3 trials. Defective CPS and impaired learning and \\nmemory are associated with the core pathological elements \\nof multiple sclerosis on MRI.

Therefore, although simple \\nneuro psychological tests are useful for routine care for \\npatients with multiple sclerosis, a need exists for more \\ncompre hensive assessment in these multiple sclerosis \\nsubpopulations.\\nThe course of cognitive decline needs further study. We \\nknow that cognitive impairment occurs in patients with \\nradio logically isolated syndrome, clinically isolated syn\\xad\\ndrome, or even the so \\xadcalled benign form of multiple \\nsclerosis. Clinicians should bear in mind that cognitive \\nimpairment can present in patients with multiple \\nsclerosis in the absence of other neurological signs or \\nsymptoms. Cognitive impairment is a common cause of \\nwork problems123 and job loss 124 and bodes poorly for the \\nrisk of future disability worsening. How much of this \\nimpairment reflects neuro degeneration that might occur \\nin otherwise stable patients is unknown, as is the degree \\nto which worsen  ing cognition reflects incomplete \\nrecovery from acute, demyelinating lesions. In reviewing \\nthe litera ture regard ing relapses, we have distinguished \\nbetween relapses in which cognitive manifestations are \\nin addition to other relapse signs, and in which cognition \\nis the only deficit—in both cases, patients might not \\nfully recover and would require follow\\xadup. Well designed \\nlongitudinal studies that account for the effects of \\ncognitive relapses from early in the course of the dis\\xad\\nease, with healthy demographically matched controls, are \\nsorely needed.\\nThe accessibility of neuropsychological testing has \\nincreased substantially over the past decade, as shown by \\nthe MSOAC61 and BICAMS52 initiatives. Additionally, the \\nrange of platforms is rapidly expanding for the appraisal \\nof cognition, including telemedicine125 and computer\\xad\\nised neuropsychological assessment devices. 67 Although \\nmore research is needed to establish the validity of many \\ncomputerised neuropsychological assessment devices, in \\nour opinion, the time has clearly come for CPS tests to be \\nused in clinical routine for varying purposes. As test  ing \\nbecomes more commonplace, documented cognitive \\ndeficits will be increasingly appreciated by clinicians as \\nanother clinical sign of acute or subacute disease activity. \\nAdministration of the SDMT or a similar task is recom\\xad\\nmended by consensus for baseline testing soon after \\ndiagnosis, annually, or as indicated for clinical purposes.126 \\nWe concur with this opinion. The SDMT is the neuro\\xad\\npsychological test that is most widely recommended \\nbecause of its sensitivity, reliability, and predictive validity \\nin patients with multiple sclerosis. To avoid overexposure \\nto the same test, different versions of the SDMT \\n(eg, adaptations for computerised neuro  psychological \\nassessment devices) should be used to screen for cognitive \\nrelapse, assess the effects of treat  ments, or for other \\npurposes. The SDMT is increasingly applied in phase 3 \\nclinical trials and efforts are underway to adjust the EDSS \\nto account for cognition.127\\nWe suggest that the SDMT is a biomarker of disease \\nactivity. Early cognitive impairment is a harbinger of future \\nneurological disability and employment loss. Account ing \\nfor cognitive relapse could enhance statistical power in \\nclinical trials in which the annualised relapse rate is the \\nprimary outcome. In the clinic, ignoring or missing cogni\\xad\\ntive changes could delay offering rehabilitative therapies.\\nIf cognitive impairment is missed, patients might be \\ndeprived of effective treatment. Debate continues about \\nsymptomatic pharmacological therapies, although some \\nstudies are encouraging.98 There is a growing literature \\nsupporting the effects of cognitive training and these \\ntreatments should be made available to patients with \\nmultiple sclerosis (table). Considering research findings \\nindicating that atrophy of key grey matter hubs and \\nnetwork disruption occur early in multiple sclerosis, \\ninterventions for cognitive impairment should also be \\napplied early in the disease course.\\nIn conclusion, the literature emboldens us to recom\\xad\\nmend the routine appraisal of cognitive function in \\npatients with multiple sclerosis for both clinical and \\nresearch purposes. Such evaluation will broaden the \\nunder stan ding of situations in which no other evidence \\nof dis ease activity is reported, identify patients in need of \\nearly intervention, and enhance the appreciation of the \\nclinical relevance of disease \\xadmodifying therapies. Tests \\nmeasuring CPS, such as the SDMT, are reproducible, \\nsensitive, and easily applied, and testing will most certainly \\nbecome more accessible with technological developments. \\nContributors\\nRHBB was the lead writer and originated the concept, design, table, and \\nfigures for the paper.

Addi -\\ntionally, the study of CNN-derived attention maps, which indicate the most relevant anatomical features for \\nCNN-based decisions, has the potential to uncover key disease mechanisms leading to disability accumulation. \\nFrom a cohort of patients prospectively followed up after a first demyelinating attack, we selected those with \\nT1-weighted and T2-FLAIR brain MRI sequences available for image analysis and a clinical assessment performed \\nwithin the following six months (N = 319). Patients were divided into two groups according to expanded \\ndisability status scale (EDSS) score: ≥ 3.0 and < 3.0. A 3D-CNN model predicted the class using whole-brain MRI \\nscans as input. A comparison with a logistic regression (LR) model using volumetric measurements as explan -\\natory variables and a validation of the CNN model on an independent dataset with similar characteristics (N =\\n440) were also performed. The layer-wise relevance propagation method was used to obtain individual attention \\nmaps. \\nThe CNN model achieved a mean accuracy of 79% and proved to be superior to the equivalent LR-model \\n(77%). Additionally, the model was successfully validated in the independent external cohort without any re- \\ntraining (accuracy = 71%). Attention-map analyses revealed the predominant role of frontotemporal cortex \\nand cerebellum for CNN decisions, suggesting that the mechanisms leading to disability accrual exceed the mere \\npresence of brain lesions or atrophy and probably involve how damage is distributed in the central nervous \\nsystem.   \\n1. Introduction \\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous \\nsystem characterised by inflammation, demyelination and \\nneurodegeneration, being one of the main non-traumatic causes of \\nirreversible disability in young adults. The exact cause of MS and the \\npathological mechanisms ultimately leading to an irreversible accumu -\\nlation of disability are still unknown.

DL techniques are not dependent on pre-defined features, instead \\nare capable of automatically extracting relevant information from raw \\nor minimally processed data. \\nIn neuroimaging, the use of CNN approaches has been useful not only \\nto extract biomarkers from MRI images, but also to address the classi -\\nfication and the prediction of different diseases ( Lian et al., 2021; van \\nder Burgh et al., 2017; Venugopalan et al., 2021 ). However, the use of \\nDL techniques to predict disease progression is still largely unexplored. \\nSome recent studies have presented promising results for future pre -\\ndiction of disability ( Roca et al., 2020; Storelli et al., 2022; Tousignant \\net al., 2019 ) and cross-sectional patient stratification ( Cruciani et al., \\n2021; Marzullo et al., 2019 ). \\nNew tendencies in the field have also put emphasis on producing \\nexplainable DL-based techniques, with the goal of disentangling the \\nreason behind DL decisions, therefore providing additional information \\nthat could be extremely useful to the end users enhancing data insights \\n( Bach et al., 2015; Simonyan et al., 2013; Springenberg et al., 2014 ). \\nThis task of deciphering the “ black box ” of DL-based models in MS has \\nrecently been studied for disease diagnosis ( Eitel et al., 2019; Lopatina \\net al., 2020 ) and MS phenotype signature decrypting ( Cruciani et al., \\n2021 ). All these studies concluded that the use of the layer-wise rele -\\nvance propagation (LRP)( Bach et al., 2015 ), among other (similar) \\nmethods, is the most promising tool for these analyses providing indi -\\nvidual heatmaps for each subject, called attention maps, reflecting the \\nvoxel-specific relevance to the classification output, according to the DL \\nmodel, in an easy and intuitive way. \\nThe main goal of this work was to build a DL-model able to accu -\\nrately classify MS patients based on their disability level, while ana -\\nlysing the CNN-derived attention maps in order to understand the \\nreasons behind the decisions taken by the DL-model. We believe these \\nanalyses may get us closer to deciphering the physiopathological \\nmechanisms responsible for clinical progression in MS. \\n2. Materials and methods \\n2.1. Datasets \\n2.1.1. In-house dataset \\nThe data used for our experiments is part of a larger in-house cohort \\nof patients followed over time after their first demyelinating attack (or \\nclinically isolated syndrome, CIS), the Barcelona CIS cohort, from the \\nMultiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia (Cemcat), Vall d ’ Hebron Uni -\\nversity Hospital (VHUH) ( Tintore et al., 2015 ). This is a prospective \\ncohort started in 1995 and is still in course. The selected subjects ’ \\nacquisition dates run from 2010 to 2020. The inclusion criteria was not \\ndependent on the clinical phenotype at the scan acquisition time point. \\nOur only requirement was that patients had to have experienced a CIS. \\nApproval was received from the Vall d ’ Hebron Institute of Research – \\nResearch and Ethics Committee (XMG-INT-2014-01 and PR(AG)389/ \\n2021) and informed consent was obtained from each patient conforming \\nthe cohort. \\nFor this cross-sectional study, we included all patients after their first \\ndemyelinating attack who had at least one brain MRI scan available for \\nimage analysis and a clinical examination within six months after the \\nscan. Clinical examinations included the assessment on the Expanded \\nDisability Status Scale (EDSS) score ( Kurtzke, 1983 ). EDSS ranges from \\n0 to 10. An EDSS of 3.0 is commonly recognised as the boundary be -\\ntween mild or no-disability vs moderate disability status ( Amato et al., \\n2008; Tintor ´e et al., 2006; Tintore et al., 2015 ). \\nWe included 319 unique patients in the study, making a total dataset \\nof 382 scans i.e., for 33 patients we used one or more MRI scans, per -\\nformed at different time-points after the first attack. The experiments \\nwere carried out with a fold cross validation strategy. Not to bias the \\nresults of the models during the cross validation strategy, we ensured \\nthat all MRI scans from a given patient were included in the same fold, \\npreventing their use for training and testing at the same time. Each scan \\nwas matched with the first EDSS score obtained within the following six \\nmonths after the MRI acquisition. \\nThe whole in-house dataset was acquired in the same centre with five \\ndifferent Siemens scanner models at two different magnetic fields (1.5 T \\n– 3.0 T). For all scanners, the MRI protocol included sagittal 3D T1 \\nmagnetization prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) and transverse \\nT2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR). The acquisition \\nprotocols of each scanner are summarised in Table 1 . \\n2.1.2. External validation (MS PATHS) dataset \\nMS PATHS (Multiple Sclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and \\nHealth Solutions)( Mowry et al., 2020 ) is a learning health system in MS, \\nstarted in 2016, comprising a collaborative network of 10 healthcare \\ncentres, providing standardised routinely-acquired clinical and MRI \\ndata. From this large database, we randomly selected a subset, with \\nrepresentation of all grades of disability, to be used as an independent \\ntest set from the models trained with the in-house dataset. The resultant \\nset was composed of 440 patients with 3D T1 MPRAGE and 3D T2-FLAIR \\nsequences from four different Siemens 3 T scanner models from six \\ndifferent sites (excluding the provider of our in-house dataset). All im -\\nages acquired using standardised image acquisition protocols, which \\ncorrespond to the 3D acquisition protocol of the Tim Trio in Table 1 . All \\npatients completed the (patient-reported outcome) Patient Determined \\nDisease Steps (PDDS) score ( Rizzo et al., 2004 ). The PDDS score ranges \\nbetween 0 and 8 and has been proven to have a strong correlation with \\nthe EDSS score ( Learmonth et al., 2013 ). \\n2.2. Image Pre-processing \\nThe same image pre-processing was applied to both datasets, in- \\nhouse dataset and MS PATHS (external validation dataset from now \\non). All T1-weighted (T1-w) and T2-FLAIR sequences were pre- \\nprocessed with (i) bias correction ( Tustison et al., 2010 ), (ii) skull- \\nstripping ( Isensee et al., 2019 ), (iii) registration ( Jenkinson & Smith, \\n2001 ) to MNI152 space (1x1x1mm\\n3\\n), as well as co-registration of T2- \\nFLAIR sequences to T1-w space, and (iv) min – max voxel intensity \\nnormalisation. \\n2.3. Proposed CNN method \\nThe proposed pipeline to stratify patients based on EDSS < 3.0 and \\nEDSS ≥ 3.0 is summarised in Fig. 1 . For the external validation experi -\\nment, patients were classified into PDDS < 3.0 (no or mild disability) \\nand PDDS ≥ 3.0 (moderate disability), since PDDS scores ≥ 3.0 indicate \\nmoderate-marked disability, equivalent to EDSS ≥ 3.0 ( Learmonth et al., \\n2013 ). \\nAfter fully pre-processing the whole-brain T2-FLAIR and T1-w scans, \\nthe volumes were cropped to the brain region obtaining the input patch \\nwith a fixed size of 144x184x152mm\\n3\\n. These patches were used as input \\nto train and test the CNN. When testing on new data, the output pre -\\ndiction was propagated to provide the LRP heatmap, complementing the \\nL.

Network architecture \\nThe proposed DL network was inspired by the ResNet CNN archi -\\ntecture ( He et al., 2016 ), built with three-dimensional (3D) layers. Each \\nresidual block is based on 3D convolutional layers that produce 3x3x3 \\nand 1x1x1 kernel convolution layers, normalised with batch normal -\\nisation and activated with a leaky rectified linear unit (LeakyReLU). As \\nshown in Fig. 2 , the architecture was composed of four residual blocks \\nwith an increasing number of kernels k (16, 32, 64 and 128), followed by \\na 2x2x2 downscale max pooling operation. Afterwards, the feature map \\nextracted was projected in a global adaptive max pooling (GAP) layer to \\nreduce feature dimensionality. The produced vector was fed into three \\nsuccessive 1x1x1 3D convolutional layers, with k = 128, 64, 2 , where the \\nfirst two were activated with a ReLU and the last one with a Softmax, \\nproviding the probability to belong to one class or another. \\n2.3.2. Training procedure \\nThe model was trained using only the in-house dataset. A 7-fold \\npatient cross-validation strategy was used to train and test the model. \\nWe sampled the folds to keep the same class distribution in each one, \\nwhile following the distribution present along the dataset.

We set a threshold of 0.5 for this probability. After inference, the probability obtained from the model is fed into the LRP algorithm to backpropagate \\nthrough the CNN and obtain the attention map. As shown in b, the training procedure is only performed with the in-house database in a cross-validation strategy, \\nhence obtaining different models.

A \\nrandom Gaussian noise ( σ = 0.02) was also used as data augmentation to \\ncreate intensity variation on both channels (T1-w and T2-FLAIR). \\nWe trained the model for a maximum of 200 epochs, with a fixed \\nbatch size of two, and an early stopping strategy based on the validation \\nloss behaviour to prevent overfitting. Every epoch the whole training set \\nwas evaluated. The model was optimised with Adam ( Kingma & Ba, \\n2015 ) with a learning decay strategy depending on the validation per -\\nformance and trained by minimising a weighted cross-entropy loss as \\ncost function. \\n2.3.3. Inference \\nFollowing the same sampling procedure described for training, the \\nwhole 3D brain was used as input through the trained model providing \\nthe output probabilities to belong to one class or another. The final \\nclassification was determined by the maximum of both probabilities, \\nwith a threshold fixed at 0.5. \\n2.4. Logistic regression model \\nTo assess whether our CNN method was superior to a more con -\\nventional statistical approach, we also built a logistic regression (LR) \\nmodel. For the LR, the disability class ( EDSS < 3.0 / EDSS ≥ 3.0 ) was \\nconsidered as the dependent variable (output) and the different volu -\\nmetric measures were considered as the explanatory variables (input). \\nVolumetric measures included: WM, GM, total intracranial, and lateral \\nventricle volumes, closely related to atrophy measures. These were \\ncalculated from the extracted brain parcellation atlas ( Henschel et al., \\n2020 ) using the T1-w lesion filled ( Prados et al., 2016 ). Brain lesion \\nvolume was also computed from the automatically extracted masks \\nobtained using LST ( Schmidt et al., 2012 ) and included as explanatory \\nvariable. \\n2.5. External validation \\nInference on the external validation dataset was computed using \\ndirectly the trained models on the in-house dataset. As seen in Fig. 1 b, \\nthe reported results were obtained using a majority voting of the seven \\ndifferent models. \\nAdditionally, the LR-models built on the in-house dataset were \\napplied to the external validation dataset in exactly the same way. \\n2.6. Attention Maps: LRP \\nTo investigate the decisions made by the CNN, attention maps were \\ncomputed in the input image space to show which were the regions that \\nsupport the decisions taken by the CNN. The method used for that was \\nthe LRP ( Bach et al., 2015 ). This technique decodes the resulting clas -\\nsification output through the network, propagating the relevance layer \\nby layer, obtaining a heatmap on the input space with each voxel \\ncontribution. \\nFor this study, we extracted the individual LRP heatmaps for each \\npatient of the in-house dataset. The implementation of the method was \\ninspired in Pytorch-LRP ( B ¨ohle et al., 2019 ), and adapted to our specific \\nCNN, with β = 0, only reflecting the positive contributions that led the \\nclassification to the winning class. The decision of choosing only the \\npositive contributions was made based on previous literature findings \\n( B ¨ohle et al., 2019 ) and corroborated with preliminary analyses on our \\nown data that showed that the negative contributions did not add \\nadditional information. \\nThe resulting LRP heatmaps were evaluated (i) individually and (ii) \\nas a class-average prediction. \\n2.6.1. Individual attention map analyses \\nIndividually, the attention maps were assessed visually and quali -\\ntatively showing which voxels contributed the most to the classification \\ngiven by the model inference. Additionally, semi-quantitative analyses \\nof the individual attention maps were carried out, multiplying such \\nmaps by a parcellation map. This allowed us to classify the relevant \\nvoxels for the CNN decision into the different anatomical areas. For this \\npurpose, we set a threshold at the 95% percentile of positive relevance, \\nto catch up the most relevant areas in each case, although other \\nthresholds have been studied (see Supplementary Material ). \\n2.6.2. Class-average attention map analyses \\nClass-average attention maps were also built for visual inspection, \\nthrough averaging the individual values of the attention maps across the \\nsubjects of each one of the prediction results: true positives (TP), false \\npositives (FP), false negatives (FN), and true negatives (TN). In addition, \\neach class-average map was multiplied by the parcellation map, and a \\nmean value per anatomical area was obtained. This allowed us to \\nidentify the anatomical areas with greatest relevance. \\n2.6.3. Voxel-wise regression to explain individual attention maps \\nWe then carried out a quantitative analysis based on the LRP heat -\\nmaps aiming at investigating to what extent the variability within each \\nvoxel (across independent subjects) of the attention map could be \\nexplained by the presence of lesions and atrophy, the best-known con -\\ntributors to disability in MS, at the voxel level. \\nFor that, we first grouped our subjects by the predicted vs real class \\n(TP, FP, FN, TN). We then computed voxel-wise regression models, one \\nper each prediction group (i.e., TP, FN, FP, TN), where the LRP value at \\neach voxel (considering all individual LRP heatmaps of the same group) \\nwas the dependent variable. As explanatory variables of these voxel- \\nwise regression models we included: i) voxel-wise binary indicator of \\nlesion (obtained from individual T2-FLAIR scans), and ii) voxel-wise \\nvalue describing the deformation suffered by the T1-w scan when \\nFigure 2.

The latter variable (ii) was used as \\nproxy for atrophy, being aware that the common template is based on \\nhealthy controls. After this step we obtained four voxel-wise maps of R- \\nsquared values, where each voxel indicated the proportion of the vari -\\nability of the LRP value that could be explained by the presence of le -\\nsions and native-to-MNI deformations. Additionally, we estimated the \\nstandardised beta coefficient for each one of the explanatory variables, \\nwhich indicated the relative importance of each one of these for the \\nprediction of the dependent variable, being the two standardised beta \\nmaps comparable (since they were in the same scale). \\n2.7. Evaluation measures of the classification models \\nTo evaluate the performance of the DL-based and LR-models, we \\nused the following metrics:  \\n• Balanced accuracy in correctly classifying each patient by means of \\ntheir EDSS, \\nAccuracy =\\nTP + TN\\nTP + TN + FP + FN\\n(1)    \\n• Sensitivity of correctly classified subjects with EDSS ≥ 3.0 , \\nSensitivity =\\nTP\\nTP + FN\\n(2)    \\n• Specificity of correctly classified subjects with EDSS < 3.0 , \\nSpecificity =\\nTN\\nTN + FP\\n(3)  \\nwhere TP are the number of correctly classified patients with EDSS ≥\\n3.0 , TN are the number of correctly classified patients with EDSS < 3.0 , \\nFP are the number of patients with EDSS < 3.0 classified as they have \\nEDSS ≥ 3.0 , and FN are the number of patients with EDSS ≥ 3.0 classified \\nas they have EDSS < 3.0 . The results are reported in terms of mean and \\nstandard deviation for the 7-fold cross validation computed on the in- \\nhouse dataset and as majority voting of the 7 models for the external \\nvalidation dataset. \\n2.8. Descriptive statistics and other general aspects \\nDescriptive statistics included comparison between the two groups \\n( EDSS < 3.0 / EDSS ≥ 3.0 ). Chi-square or mixed-effects linear regression \\nmodels accounting for repeated measures were used, as appropriate. \\nThe proposed method and analyses were entirely implemented in \\nPython ( https://www.python.org/ ), using the Pytorch library ( Paszke \\net al., 2019 ). We ran all the experiments on a GNU/Linux machine box \\nrunning Ubuntu 20.04, with 128 GB RAM. For training the model, we \\nused a single Quadro RTX 5000 GPU (NVIDIA Corp, USA) with 16 GB \\nVRAM memory. \\n3. Results \\n3.1. Evaluation of DL-models: in-house dataset \\nOut of the 319 patients, 104 were assigned with EDSS ≥ 3.0 and 215 \\nwith EDSS < 3.0 . This meant a volume of 215 MRI scans with EDSS < \\n3.0 , and 167 MRI scans with EDSS ≥ 3.0 (non-confirmed). The two \\nstratification groups showed comparable demographic, clinical and MRI \\ncharacteristics, as summarised in Table 2 . The full cohort EDSS median \\nwas 2.0, with a median of 1.5 (in range 0.0 – 2.5) for patients with EDSS \\n< 3.0 and 4.0 (in range 3.0 – 9.0) for patients with EDSS ≥ 3.0 . Patients \\nwith EDSS ≥ 3.0 had a longer disease duration than patients with EDSS \\n< 3.0 , with a similar age at CIS with a mean age of approximately 30 \\nyears old ( SD = 8 ). Compared with patients with EDSS < 3.0 , patients \\nwith EDSS ≥ 3.0 had lower tissue volumes, GM, WM and total intra -\\ncranial volume, and higher ventricle volume and lesion load. \\nThe average accuracy of the in-house dataset across the seven folds \\nwith the whole brain input patch was 79% ( SD = 4% ), with a sensitivity \\nof 77% ( SD = 5% ) identifying patients with EDSS ≥ 3.0 , and a specificity \\nof 81% ( SD = 9% ) identifying patients with EDSS < 3.0. \\n3.2. Comparison with a LR-model \\nThe LR-model built with the six brain volumes corresponding to WM, \\nGM, ventricles, brainstem and cerebellum, intracranial volume and \\nlesion load, achieved an accuracy of 77% ( SD = 7% ), with a sensitivity of \\n68% ( SD = 10% ) when classifying patients with EDSS ≥ 3.0 and a \\nspecificity of 86% (SD = 6%). Therefore, the LR-model trained with MRI \\npre-extracted features showed a 10% lower sensitivity than DL-based \\nmodels. When considering other input combinations with fewer fea -\\ntures, the LR-model obtained always inferior results than the CNN \\nTable 2 \\nDemographic, clinical and brain MRI characteristics of MS patients from the in- \\nhouse database.   \\nFull cohort \\nN\\nPAC/SCAN \\n=\\n319/382 \\nEDSS < 3.0 \\nN = 215/ \\n215 \\nEDSS ≥ 3.0 \\nN = 104/ \\n167 \\np -value \\nFemale, n (%) 207 (65) 147 (64) 60 (58)  0.08 \\nAge at CIS, years, mean \\n[range] \\n32.3 [14 – 50] 32.4 \\n[14 – 49] \\n32.2 \\n[14 – 50]  \\n0.78 \\nConfirmed diagnosis\\na\\n, \\nn (%) \\n260 (82) 160 (74) 100 (96)  < 0.001 \\nAge at diagnose, years, \\nmean [range] \\n33.2 [14 – 59] 33.5 \\n[16 – 59] \\n32.7 \\n[14 – 55]  \\n0.43 \\nCIS topography, n (%)     < 0.001 \\nBrain stem 83 (26) 59 (27) 24 (23)  \\nOptic nerve 98 (31) 74 (35) 24 (23)  \\nSpinal cord 98 (31) 60 (28) 38 (37)  \\nOther 40 (12) 22 (10) 18 (17)  \\nMS topography, n (%)     < 0.001 \\nCIS 123 (39) 106 (49.5) 17 (16)  \\nSP 41 (13) 1 (0.5) 40 (39)  \\nRR 155 (48) 108 (50) 47 (45)  \\nPresence of OB, n (%)     < 0.001 \\nPositive 194 (61) 115 (53) 79 (75)  \\nNegative 75 (23) 64 (30) 11 (12)  \\nUnknown 50 (16) 36 (17) 14 (13)  \\nDD, years, mean (SD) 10.4 (7.0) 7.6 (6.6) 14.0 (5.6)  < 0.001 \\nEDSS, median [range] 2.0 [0.0 – 9.0] 1.5 \\n[0.0 – 2.5] \\n5.0 \\n[3.0 – 9.0]  \\n< 0.001 \\nLesion load, ml, mean \\n(SD) \\n27.5 (39.9) 10.4 (13.1) 49.6 (50.7)  < 0.001 \\nVentricles vol, ml, \\nmean (SD) \\n29.7 (19.8) 21.5 (9.6) 40.2 (25.3)  < 0.001 \\nGM vol, ml, mean (SD) 787.9 (64.0) 813.1 \\n(48.3) \\n755.4 \\n(67.2)  \\n< 0.001 \\nWM vol, ml, mean (SD) 694.8 (68.0) 707.5 \\n(54.3) \\n678.3 \\n(79.6)  \\n< 0.001 \\nBrain vol, ml, mean \\n(SD) \\n1542.7 \\n(103.7) \\n1572.0 \\n(83.7) \\n1504.8 \\n(114.4)  \\n< 0.001 \\nScanner model     < 0.001 \\nAvanto, n (%) 64 (17) 19 (9) 45 (27)  \\nAvanto Fit, n (%) 64 (17) 43 (20) 21 (13)  \\nSymphony, n (%) 10 (3) 7 (3) 3 (2)  \\nSymphony Tim, n (%) 51 (13) 13 (6) 38 (23)  \\nTim Trio, n (%) 193 (50) 133 (62) 60 (36)  \\nPAC : patients; EDSS : expanded disability status scale; CIS : clinically isolated \\nsyndrome; SP: secondary progressive; RR: relapsing remitting; OB : oligoclonal \\nbands; DD : disease duration; GM : grey matter; WM : white matter. \\na\\nMS confirmed diagnosis by McDonald 2017 criteria.

External validation dataset \\nTable 3 summarises the demographic, clinical and MRI data char -\\nacteristics of the patients included in the external validation dataset. In \\nthis external validation dataset, 220 patients were categorised to the \\ngroup with PDDS ≥ 3.0 and 220 with PDDS < 3.0 . The full median \\ncohort PDDS was 2.5, with a median of 0.5 (in range 0.0 – 2.0) for the \\ngroup of no or mild disability patients ( PDDS < 3.0 ) and 5.0 (in range \\n3.0 – 7.0) for the group of more disabled patients ( PDDS ≥ 3.0 ). As for the \\nin-house dataset, the disease duration was longer in patients with more \\ndisability, with a mean age at diagnosis of 36 years old, and MRI char -\\nacteristics kept the same relation between groups. \\nIn this validation dataset, the majority voting system after applying \\nthe seven DL models trained on the in-house cohort showed an accuracy \\nof 71%, a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 75%. In contrast, when \\nwe applied the different LR-models to the validation dataset, we ach -\\nieved accuracies close to 50% only. \\n3.4. DL-based attention maps analyses \\n3.4.1. Individual attention maps \\nIndividual attention maps showed that, in both disability groups, the \\nmost relevant voxels that led the classification decisions were mainly \\nlocated in the periventricular WM regions, which often contained \\ndemyelinating lesions, and frontal and temporal cortical areas (see \\nexample Fig. 3 a). Fig. 3 b shows a case-example of the distribution of \\nrelevant voxels across the different anatomical regions, considering all \\nvoxels with a relevance above a 95% percentile. Other thresholds were \\nalso explored (see Supplementary Fig. 1 ), however insignificant changes \\nin the distribution were observed. \\n3.4.2. Class-average attention maps \\nClass-average maps revealed that the most relevant areas were the \\nfrontal cortex, cerebellar cortex, periventricular WM, temporal cortex \\nand lateral ventricles, as shown in Fig. 4 . The ranking of these regions \\nslightly varied across the different groups (TP, FP, TN, FN). For the \\npatients classified with EDSS ≥ 3.0 (TP, FP), the relevance of periven -\\ntricular and frontal WM, where most lesions are located, was particu -\\nlarly high. Instead, for no or mild-disability statuses (TN, FN), the \\nrelevance of the cortex, especially frontal and temporal cortical areas, \\nand that of the cerebellum were the highest. \\n3.4.3. Voxel-wise regression analyses \\nAfter carrying out the voxel-wise regressions on the in-house dataset, \\nwe obtained R-squared maps for the four prediction groups ( Fig. 5 ). In \\ngeneral, the R-squared values were low in all four groups, and mostly \\nranged between 0 and 0.2. In the correctly classified groups (TP, TN), \\nthe R-squared values were even lower (0 – 0.1). That means that in these \\ngroups, at most the 80% of the variability of the attention map could not \\nbe explained by the presence of lesions (observed in T2-FLAIR scans) or \\nthe native-to-MNI deformation (of the T1-w scans), calculated through \\nthe Jacobian determinant. \\nWhen focused on the maps of partial R-squared, we found that values \\nwere always greater for the presence of lesions than for the Jacobian \\ndeterminant ( Fig. 5 ). \\n4. Discussion \\nIn this work, we investigated the use of DL-models to classify MS \\npatients according to their disability status while trying to provide an \\nexplanation of the decisions taken by the CNN. Our findings showed that \\na DL-based model using only brain MRI scans, without any guidance, \\nwas able to stratify MS patients with high accuracy (79%) when testing \\ndata from the same cohort, and 71% when testing images from an un -\\nseen database (external validation dataset). Furthermore, the compari -\\nson with the LR-model brought to light the superiority of the CNN \\nmodel. Finally, our attention-map analyses revealed that the most \\nrelevant anatomical areas that the CNN model used to decide the level of \\npatients ’ disability were the frontotemporal cortex and the cerebellum \\nand did not depend on the mere presence of lesions or atrophy in these \\nlocations. \\nCompared with previously reported studies that used DL-based \\nmodels to perform predictions of MS progression, our work presents \\nsome similarities and some major differences. Despite the differences in \\nthe target of the classification, i.e., cross-sectional vs future predictions, \\nall published studies ( Storelli et al., 2022; Tousignant et al., 2019 ), like \\nours, used the whole brain as input to the network. However, in our \\nstudy, we only used routinely-acquired T1-w and T2-FLAIR MRI data, \\nwhereas other studies required the use of several MRI modalities and \\nadditional masks ( Tousignant et al., 2019 ) to achieve similar accuracies. \\nOf note, we validated our CNN model on an external, unseen cohort, \\nwhere the performance of the classification task was more than \\nacceptable, without needing any recalibration or re-training of the \\nmodel. This utterly necessary step of validating the CNN model \\n(although uncommon in the literature) strengthens our findings, laying \\nthe foundation for future longitudinal, comprehensive models of MS \\ndisease progression. Furthermore, having at hand an excellent tool to \\ndiscriminate patients according to their disability level may be \\nextremely useful in contexts where the EDSS score is not obtained as part \\nof routine practice ( Bove et al., 2023 ). Such a discriminating tool may \\nallow the fast identification of patients who already present a certain \\ndegree of disability and who, therefore, are at high risk of reaching \\nunfavourable clinical outcomes ( Signori et al., 2023 ). To further assess \\nour model robustness to the actual disability threshold used to classify \\npatients or the distribution of disability scores in the given study pop -\\nulation, we carried out a post-hoc analysis on the in-house cohort where \\nwe only considered those patients with an EDSS ≤ 2.0 or ≥ 4.0 . We \\nobserved that the performance of the model only improved by 2%, i.e., \\nwe obtained an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 81%, 79%, and \\n83%, respectively. This slight increase in model performance may \\nhighlight the robustness of our CNN model, whose accuracy did not \\nseem too dependent on the threshold used to classify patients into \\ndisability groups or how the disability scores were distributed in our \\ncohort. Other data-related aspects that may have affected model per -\\nformance include the imbalance between classes in terms of scanner \\nmodels. That is, while 62% of patients in the group with an EDSS < 3.0 \\nwere scanned in the Tim Trio scanner, only a 36% of patients with an \\nEDSS ≥ 3.0 did so ( Table 2 ). For this reason, we performed a post-hoc \\nTable 3 \\nDemographic, clinical and brain MRI characteristics of MS patients from the \\nexternal database.   \\nFull cohort  \\nN = 440 \\nPDDS < 3.0 \\nN = 220 \\nPDDS ≥ 3.0 \\nN = 220 \\np -value \\nFemale, n (%) 310 (70) 170 (77) 140 (64)  0.007 \\nAge at diagnosis, years, \\nmean [range] \\n36.8 \\n[19 – 69] \\n36.1 \\n[19 – 62] \\n37.6 \\n[19 – 69]  \\n0.24 \\nDD, years, mean (SD) 11.5 (9.1) 8.5 (7.6) 14.9 (9.5)  < 0.001 \\nPDDS, median [range] 2.5 \\n[0.0 – 7.0] \\n0.5 \\n[0.0 – 2.0] \\n5.0 \\n[3.0 – 7.0]  \\n< 0.001 \\nLesion load, ml, mean \\n(SD) \\n13.2 (24.7) 7.9 (11.7) 18.5 (32.0)  < 0.001 \\nVentricles vol, ml, mean \\n(SD) \\n35.9 (24.0) 28.7 (17.4) 43.1 (27.4)  < 0.001 \\nGM vol, ml, mean (SD) 804.6 \\n(73.5) \\n828.4 \\n(64.6) \\n779.7 \\n(74.0)  \\n< 0.001 \\nWM vol, ml, mean (SD) 706.1 \\n(53.4) \\n718.6 \\n(47.3) \\n693.6 \\n(56.3)  \\n< 0.001 \\nBrain vol, ml, mean (SD) 1496.4 \\n(92.8) \\n1526.2 \\n(79.7) \\n1466.5 \\n(95.7)  \\n< 0.001 \\nPDDS : patient determined disease steps; DD : disease duration; GM : grey matter; \\nWM : white matter. \\nL.

On the other hand, LR-models are \\nbased on obtained volumetric measurements that need to be previously \\ncomputed using different tools which can be affected by changes on the \\nMRI scanners and image protocols used to acquire the data. Thus, \\nconsidering that volumetric measures have been frequently used as \\noutcome measures in clinical trials ( Tur et al., 2018b ), our findings \\nsuggest that DL-based discriminative tools may also be considered as \\ntrial outcomes, given that seem to explain clinical outcome better than \\nconventional volumetric measures feeding into a LR model. Further \\nresearch in this regard, evaluating the CNN model ’ s sensitivity to clin -\\nical change, is therefore warranted. \\nFinally, in this study we attempted to understand the reasons behind \\nFig. 3.

Moreover, other studies have mainly investigated the classifica -\\ntion between healthy controls and patients ( B ¨ohle et al., 2019; Eitel \\net al., 2019; Lopatina et al., 2020 ), whereas the task of classifying pa -\\ntients into different disability classes, as in our study, is possibly much \\nmore challenging, given the continuous nature of the disease. Thus, we \\nwent a step further trying to apply such methods on patients only , i.e., \\nmoderately disabled and mildly or non-disabled, with a priori no clear \\npathological boundaries between them, making it very difficult their \\nidentification by providing only brain MRI data to the model. With these \\nanalyses we found that the voxels with the highest relevance for the CNN \\nto make the final decisions were in the frontal and temporal cortex, \\nfollowed by brainstem/cerebellum, and periventricular WM. \\nThe importance of cortical GM for disease progression has been \\nsuggested in several studies, although the proposed underlying patho -\\nlogical mechanisms differ across studies. For instance, loss of cortical \\nGM volume ( Cordano et al., 2022 ), microstructural cortical damage, \\nreflected by increased total sodium concentration ( Collorone et al., \\n2021 ), or grey matter demyelination ( Gilmore et al., 2009 ), including \\nthe presence of visible lesions in the cortex ( Madsen et al., 2022 ), may all \\ncontribute to the accumulation of disability. Furthermore, the loss of the \\nphysiological balance between the cortical thickness of different areas \\nhas also been proposed as a process potentially leading to clinical \\ndysfunction in MS ( Tur et al., 2018a; Tur et al., 2019 ). However, no \\nproper head-to-head comparisons across mechanisms have been carried \\nout, which makes it difficult to understand the hierarchy or dynamics of \\nsuch pernicious pathological events. In any case, it is plausible that our \\nCNN has captured at least some of the imaging features related to them. \\nThe consistency across individuals in terms of these areas likely reveal \\ngenuine differences between subjects, possibly related to atrophy, \\nalthough not only: looking at the results of the voxel-wise regression \\n( Fig. 5 ), it is possible that other pathological aspects, for example \\nchanges in image texture denoting underlying non-obvious demyelin -\\nation, may be playing a role too. On the other hand, it must be \\nacknowledged that some of the highlighted attentions in the cortex \\nmight also be caused by non-pathological aspects such as registration \\ninaccuracies. Although the high accuracy of the model might lead us to \\nthink that the potential impact of registration inaccuracies on model \\nperformance was not major, this would need to be assessed in further \\nstudies. That is, we are unable to discern if all the attentions were related \\nor not to pathological aspects, which is a limitation of the current study. \\nIt should also be highlighted the involvement of brainstem/cerebellum, \\nwhose role in disability progression in MS has been repeatedly seen in \\nthe literature ( Palesi et al., 2015; Savini et al., 2019; Tintore et al., \\n2010 ). Future studies should investigate whether those relevant imaging \\naspects present in the brainstem/cerebellum have the same pathological \\ntranslation as those of the relevant cortical areas. An interesting note is \\nthat the frontal cortex and the cerebellum have a strong anatomical \\nconnection through two distinct fronto-cerebellar pathways, which are \\nknown to be damaged in toxic conditions involving the CNS, such as \\nalcohol ( Rogers et al., 2012 ) or heroin abuse ( Wang et al., 2013 ). Future \\nstudies will elucidate whether these paths are also altered in MS and, \\nespecially, whether such alteration may be a key step in the develop -\\nment of irreversible disability. \\nThe relevance of periventricular WM may be related to the presence \\nof demyelinating lesions, which tend to appear in this location \\n( Thompson et al., 2018 ), but also to lateral and third ventricle \\nFig. 5.

Agreeing with that, cases with moderate disability presented a \\nhigher mean lesion load in periventricular WM than in mildly or non- \\ndisabled cases. \\nInterestingly, these structures are followed by the thalamus, which \\nalso appears to be very relevant for the CNNs, in line with previous \\nstudies showing the importance of deep GM structures for disease pro -\\ngression in MS ( Eshaghi et al., 2018 ). All these relevant areas were \\nbrought to light through both the individual attention map and the class- \\naverage map analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time \\nthat such areas have been identified as relevant for clinical progression \\nin MS in a completely hypothesis-free (unguided) manner, that is, \\nwithout forcing the model to pay attention to them. \\nRegarding the voxel-wise regression analysis, the most striking \\nfinding was that the attention within a voxel, which indicates the \\nimportance of a given voxel to decide the disability class of a given \\npatient, was not (only) explained by the mere presence of lesions or \\nnative-to-MNI deformation (used as proxy for volume change or atro -\\nphy) in that particular voxel. This may suggest that DL-based methods \\npay attention to more general aspects of the image, possibly focusing on \\ncomplex spatial relationships between voxel-wise information, consid -\\nering that distributional features of brain lesions might impact on \\ndisability progression ( Tur et al., 2022 ), or image texture-related in -\\nformation, maybe denoting microscopic processes such as underlying \\ndemyelination ( Gilmore et al., 2009 ). Of note, these more general as -\\npects of the image deserve further research and, anyway cannot be \\nsummarised as presence/absence of lesions and/or atrophy in a given \\npoint. \\nIn any case, our findings strongly support the use of DL-based \\nmethods to perform classification/prediction tasks where the input \\ndata is derived from images, in line with the superiority observed by our \\nCNN with respect to the LR-model. This confirms the potential of DL- \\nbased models to unveil key aspects of the disease which are uncatch -\\nable by the human eye. Future studies focusing on unveiling these as -\\npects are therefore warranted. \\nPotential implications for clinical practice of our findings may \\ninclude, in the short term, the application of CNN-based models to \\nautomatically classify patients according to their disability status using \\nonly routinely acquired brain MRI scans. This may be extremely useful \\nin situations where large-scale therapeutic interventions, which may \\nvary depending on the disability status of a given patient population, \\nneed to be planned in a relatively rapid manner. Other, mid-term im -\\nplications include those derived from the development of CNN-based \\nmodels to predict future disability, which may be extremely powerful \\nto manage patient expectations and design tailored treatment strategies. \\nThat is, we should acknowledge that this is a cross-sectional study and, \\ntherefore, no strong statements about prediction of disease prognosis \\nbased on our specific CNN model can be made. However, we believe that \\nour findings will help build powerful predictive models, possibly \\nfocusing on those areas identified as highly relevant through the \\nattention map analyses. Up to now, most of those CNN-based models for \\nfuture prediction that have been published so far show a relatively \\nlimited accuracy, implying that more research is sorely needed ( Roca \\net al., 2020; Storelli et al., 2022; Tousignant et al., 2019 ). \\nAmong the methodological considerations and possible limitations \\nof our study, it is worth mentioning the relatively small sample size, \\nconsidering the data needs of DL-based models. For this reason and to \\nmake the most of the data available, we did not apply any restriction to \\nthe disease duration of our patients and considered each individual scan \\nwhich could be matched to an EDSS score as an independent piece of \\ninformation. As future work, we would like to analyse the impact of \\nadding clinical data, such as disease duration, age at CIS or sex, on model \\nperformance. Additionally, we applied data augmentation strategies \\nwhen possible. As a result of all these strategies, the final (in-house) \\ndatabase used for training, overall, had enough variability, proving \\nrobustness and generalisation of our models to scans from the same \\nvendor. Even though the data from the different MR scanner models \\nused for training were not balanced, they were so in terms of strength \\nfield. This was confirmed by the excellent reproducibility of the models \\nwhen we applied them to the external (i.e., completely unseen) valida -\\ntion cohort, despite the fact the disability score was not the same than \\nthe one used for training. Another remark relates to the fact that we did \\nnot account for potential disease-modifying treatment effects. Future \\nstudies accounting for these are therefore warranted. Concerning the \\nattention maps, they are limited by the lack of a ground truth. Surely, \\nother methodological choices could have been made, providing (prob -\\nably) slightly different results, which deserve further research. More -\\nover, we tried to relate the attention maps with well-known biomarkers \\nof the disease, whereas future studies should investigate the association \\nwith new, possibly more promising, biomarkers. \\n5. Conclusions \\nIn conclusion, our CNN model was able to stratify MS patients based \\non their disability score solely using a single time-point brain MRI (T1-w \\nand T2-FLAIR sequences) providing an excellent performance. \\nFurthermore, our findings bring to light the potential of DL-based \\nmodels to provide key information about the mechanisms responsible \\nfor the accumulation of disability in MS, suggesting the relevant role of \\nfrontotemporal cortex and cerebellum for the development of irrevers -\\nible disability. Importantly, these findings may have immediate and \\nespecially long-term implications for clinical practice, laying the foun -\\ndations for building powerful predictive models of future disability. \\nCRediT authorship contribution statement \\nLlucia Coll: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Data cura -\\ntion, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, \\nWriting – review & editing.

Rocca1,3,4 and Massimo Filippi 1,2,3,4,5 ✉\\n© The Author(s) 2023\\nNeuropsychiatric abnormalities may be broadly divided in two categories: disorders of mood, affect, and behavior and\\nabnormalities affecting cognition. Among these conditions, clinical depression, anxiety and neurocognitive disorders are the most\\ncommon in multiple sclerosis (MS), with a substantial impact on patients’ quality of life and adherence to treatments. Such\\nmanifestations may occur from the earliest phases of the disease but become more frequent in MS patients with a progressive\\ndisease course and more severe clinical disability. Although the pathogenesis of these neuropsychiatric manifestations has not\\nbeen fully deﬁned yet, brain structural and functional abnormalities, consistently observed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),\\ntogether with genetic and immunologic factors, have been suggested to be key players. Even though the detrimental clinical\\nimpact of such manifestations in MS patients is a matter of crucial importance, at present, they are often overlooked in the clinical\\nsetting. Moreover, the efﬁcacy of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches for their amelioration has been poorly\\ninvestigated, with the majority of studies showing marginal or no beneﬁcial effect of different therapeutic approaches, possibly due\\nto the presence of multiple and heterogeneous underlying pathological mechanisms and intrinsic methodological limitations. A\\nbetter evaluation of these manifestations in the clinical setting and improvements in the understanding of their pathophysiology\\nmay offer the potential to develop tools for differentiating these mechanisms in individual patients and ultimately provide a\\nprincipled basis for treatment selection. This review provides an updated overview regarding the pathophysiology of the most\\ncommon neuropsychiatric symptoms in MS, the clinical and MRI characteristics that have been associated with mood disorders (i.e.,\\ndepression and anxiety) and cognitive impairment, and the treatment approaches currently available or under investigation.\\nTranslational Psychiatry          (2023) 13:264 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-023-02555-7\\nINTRODUCTION\\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inﬂammatory, demyelinating\\nand neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous\\nsystem (CNS), often leading to the accumulation of irreversible\\nclinical disability [1].\\nDuring recent years, there has been an increasing under-\\nstanding of MS pathophysiology which has in ﬂuenced the\\ndevelopment of novel treatment approaches. Beside locomotor\\ndisability, the growing evidence of neuropsychiatric symptoms\\noccurrence in MS has provided new valuable insights in the\\npathophysiology of the disease, enabling novel therapeutic\\ntargets aimed to improve MS patients’ management [2, 3].\\nAmong neuropsychiatric abnormalities, cognitive impairment,\\nclinical depression, and anxiety are the most common with a\\nhigher frequency in MS patients compared to the general\\npopulation [4].\\nIt is now clear that the evaluation of physical disability should\\nbe combined with neuropsychological batteries and scales for a\\nmore detailed characterization of cognitive performance, depres-\\nsive and anxiety symptoms, often neglected in the clinical\\npractice, even though they have profound consequences on\\npatients’ daily activities and quality of life (QoL).\\nIn this scenario, the application of magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI) measures, which are speci ﬁc to different pathological\\nsubstrates of MS, has consistently shown that, in addition to\\ngenetic, environmental and immunologic factors, structural and\\nfunctional abnormalities in relevant brain regions and networks\\nmay contribute to identify the mechanisms of these hetero-\\ngeneous manifestations of the disease [3]. Moreover, emerging\\nﬁndings suggest that speciﬁc pharmacologic and rehabilitative\\napproaches can exert beneﬁcial effects on cognitive functioning,\\nmood disorders and fatigue, improving MS patient’s QoL.\\nIn this review, we endeavor to provide a concise and updated\\noverview regarding the most common neuropsychiatric symp-\\ntoms of patients with MS, moving from pathophysiology to\\ntreatment approaches.\\nDEPRESSIVE AND ANXIETY DISORDERS\\nMajor depressive disorder\\nEpidemiological and clinical features.

Other symptoms, such as neurovegetative symptoms, including\\nfatigue, loss of appetite or weight, and insomnia, are common also\\nin other medical conditions [6].\\nIf episodes of depression do not resolve and last for extended\\nperiods of time, this pattern is described as chronic depression. If\\ndepressive symptoms are present (on most days) for at least 2\\nyears without any periods of remission exceeding 2 months, the\\ncondition is termed persistent depressive disorder or dysthymia\\n[7].\\nThe 12-month prevalence of MDD in general population varies\\nconsiderably across countries but is approximately 6%, overall [8].\\nInterestingly, the 12-month prevalence of MDD is similar when\\ncomparing high-income countries (5.5%) with low- and middle-\\nincome countries (5.9%), suggesting that MDD is neither a simple\\nconsequence of modern day lifestyle in developed countries, nor\\npoverty [9].\\nIn MS, clinical depression is higher than in other neurologic\\ndisorders [10] and, depending on the reference point, is 3–10\\ntimes the rate in the general population [11].\\nAccording to a comprehensive systematic review [12], clinical\\ndepression represents the most prevalent comorbidity in MS\\n(23.7%), followed by anxiety (21.9%), hypertension (18.6%),\\nhypercholesterolemia (10.9%), and chronic lung disease (10%). A\\nrecent meta-analysis reported a higher prevalence of clinical\\ndepression in MS; the weighted prevalence of 58 studies on\\ndepression in MS was 30.5% (95% con ﬁdence intervals\\n[CI] = 26.3–35.1%) [13].\\nSimilarly to the general population, the prevalence peak is\\ngenerally between 45 and 59 years in these patients [ 14].\\nDifferently from other comorbidities, such as hypertension and\\nhypercholesterolemia, the prevalence of clinical depression seems\\nnot increasing with age [15]. While some studies reported a higher\\nprevalence of depressive symptoms in female MS patients with a\\nhistory of depression [16–18], others did not [19].\\nDepressive symptoms typically associate with a progressive MS\\ncourse, leading to severe consequences on cognitive performance\\nand worsening physical disability [20–22].\\nSeveral scales have been proposed to score depressive\\nsymptoms in MS patients (Table 1). According to the evidence-\\nbased guidelines of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN)\\n[23], the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scale is recommended\\nfor assessing depression in these patients [ 24]. It should be\\nmentioned that this scale has to be adapted, since some questions\\noverlap with disability. Other scales, including the BDI-II [25] and\\nMontgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) [26], are\\ncommonly used in clinical practice (Table1).\\nSeveral studies showed that depressive symptoms severity was\\nassociated with fatigue, even after adjusting for disability status,\\nand these conditions were signiﬁcant and independent predictors\\nof QoL in MS patients [20–22]. Depressive symptoms also related\\nto cognitive functioning in MS since they negatively impact\\nperformance of attention, working memory, executive functions\\nand information processing speed [27–30]. Indeed, MS patients\\nwith depressive symptoms have worse cognitive outcomes\\ncompared to HC but also to MS patients without depressive\\nsymptoms [22, 31, 32].\\nSuicide is a relevant consequence of depression with a\\nprevalence reported up to 22.1% in MS [33], twice compared to\\nthe general population [34]. Risk factors for the development of\\nsuicidal ideation include current depressive symptoms, being\\nfemale [35], young age at onset of MS, previous history of\\ndepression, social isolation, recent functional deterioration and\\nabuse of illicit substance [36, 37].\\nPathophysiology. The pathogenesis of MS-related depressive\\nsymptoms is multifactorial. Genetic, immunologic, structural and\\nfunctional brain damage might contribute to the presence of such\\nmanifestations in MS patients [38].\\nAlthough the role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of\\ndepression in MS has been poorly explored, a correlation between\\nthe presence of Apolipoproteinε2 allele and a decreased incidence\\nTable 1.

Pro-in ﬂammatory\\ncytokines may affect serotonin synthesis and reuptake in the CNS,\\nand, consequently, may lead to the malfunctioning of noradre-\\nnergic and serotoninergic circuits that represent the pathways\\ntargeted by several antidepressant drugs [ 42–44]. Speciﬁcally,\\ninterferon (IFN)-γ may induce tryptophan metabolism and higher\\nblood cytokine levels, in particular interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and\\ntumor necrosis factor-α, which might constitute the trigger for the\\nincreased secretion of adrenal corticosteroids through the\\nactivation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, linked\\nto the onset of depressive symptoms [42–44]. In MS, immune\\nsystem abnormalities are believed to occur before the onset of\\ndepression, but the suggestion that depression is always\\nsecondary to inﬂammation is controversial [40], because depres-\\nsion itself may compromise the immune system.\\nAs discussed below, structural and functional brain abnormal-\\nities, especially involving fronto-temporal and limbic cortices, are\\nalso related to the presence and worsening of depression in MS\\npatients. Notably, abnormalities in communication between key\\nanatomical areas involved in modulation of mood (i.e., amygdala\\nand ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) in relation to speciﬁc tasks\\nwere observed in MS patients, even in the absence of depression\\n[45]. These ﬁndings might explain, at least partially, the high\\nproportion of MS patients with depressive symptoms, as\\ndisconnection of a key mood-regulation pathway could compro-\\nmise an individual’s emotional adaptability when confronted by\\nthe vicissitudes of life.\\nMRI ﬁndings. MS is classically characterized by the formation of\\nmacroscopic focal white matter (WM) lesions and diffuse damage\\nto the so-called normal-appearing WM (NAWM) [ 1]. Besides,\\npathological and MRI studies have consistently shown the\\npresence of abnormalities also affecting deep gray matter (GM)\\nand cortex [1].\\nCompared to non-depressed, depressed MS patients showed\\nhigher brain T2-hyperintense lesion volume (LV) in the temporal\\nlobe [46] and arcuate fasciculus [ 47, 48], and higher T1-\\nhypointense WM LV in the superior frontal and parietal regions\\n[49]. The described lesions were located at the projection areas of\\nthe basal limbic system [46], in line with neuropathological studies\\nin depressed patients with Parkinson’s disease showing reduced\\nneuronal cell count in nuclei associated with the limbic system,\\nsuch as the raphe nuclei, the ventral segmental nuclei or the locus\\ncoeruleus [50, 51]. Notably, a similar localization of WM lesions was\\nalso observed in depressed patients with vascular pathology,\\nsuggesting a common pathogenesis of secondary depression [52].\\nRecently, advanced MRI techniques have shed light on brain\\nmicrostructural abnormalities associated with depression in MS\\npatients. A lower NAWM fractional anisotropy and a higher mean\\ndiffusivity in the NAGM in the temporal lobe and in inferior frontal\\nregions, and atrophy of cortical regions located in the bilateral frontal\\nlobes were found in MS patients with depression compared to those\\nwithout depression [53]. Atrophy of cortical regions located in the\\nbilateral frontal lobes and entorhinal cortex and cerebellum were also\\nsigniﬁcant predictors of depression [54–56]. An involvement of\\nhippocampus has also been described in depressed-MS patients, as\\ndemonstrated in a study where hippocampal atrophy correlated with\\nthe severity of depression [57].\\nMoreover, structural connectivity abnormalities between the right\\nhippocampus, right amygdala and frontal regions were associated\\nwith the presence of depression, suggesting that connectivity\\nalterations at the limbic-motor interface may explain the occurrence\\nof depression in MS patients [58].\\nFunctional MRI (fMRI) studies showed an increased activity of the\\nventrolateral prefrontal cortex, with, however, a trend to\\nhypoconnectivity with the amygdala and the medial prefrontal\\ncortex in MS patients with depression. This is possibly related to a\\nmaladaptive emotional coping that might cause a higher vulner-\\nability to depression of MS patients [45].\\nWhen evaluating resting state (RS) fMRI, a functional disconnection\\nof the hippocampus with regions of the default mode network due\\nto the accumulation of focal WM lesions has been found to be\\nassociated with depression [59], as well as an imbalance in the RS FC\\nof the salience network, executivecontrol network in cognitively\\npreserved MS patients with depression [ 60]. Of note, these\\nabnormalities were also observed in MS patients with cognitive\\nimpairment, possibly reﬂecting a common pathophysiology leading\\nto an overlapping symptomatology (e.g., concentration and memory\\ndifﬁculties).\\nRecently, the potential contribution of HPA axis on depression in\\nMS patients has been explored with controversial results [61, 62].\\nProton magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed increased gluta-\\nmate levels in the hypothalamus of MS patients with depression,\\npossibly reﬂecting a metabolic involvement of this structure in\\ndepression-related processes [61]. Another study showed that MS-\\nrelated depression was associatedwith more distributed abnormal-\\nities involving the three explored monoaminergic networks (i.e.,\\ndopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin transporters), resulting in\\noverall reduced RS FC in the frontal lobe, limbic areas and the\\nprecuneus [62]. Conversely, no signiﬁcant associations between GM\\natrophy and atlas-based distribution of the main neurotransmitters\\n(i.e., serotonergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic, cholinergic and\\nglutamatergic maps) were found for depression in a recent study\\n[63]. These discrepancies may be related, at least partially, to the\\ndifferent methodologies applied (structural vs fMRI), as well as\\ndifferent MS populations investigated.\\nTherapeutic approaches . Diagnosis and treatment of mood\\ndisorders are fundamental to improve MS patient ’s daily-life\\nactivities, QoL, as well as therapeutic compliance and adherence.\\nTreatment of depression should be individualized and involve an\\nassociation between pharmacological and non-pharmacological\\ntreatments.\\nA Cochrane review, published in 2011 [64], selected only two\\ncontrolled double-blind randomized trials (RCTs). Desipramine (a\\ntricyclic antidepressant) at the highest dosage of 200 mg/day [65]\\nand paroxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) at a\\ndosage of up to 40 mg/day [66] were compared with placebo in\\n32 and 42 depressed-MS patients, respectively on a 5- and 12-\\nweek period. In both trials, a trend towards efﬁcacy was observed,\\nalthough not reaching statistical signiﬁcance.\\nIn the absence of newer RCTs or observational studies in MS,\\ntreatment should follow the same guidelines as for the general\\npopulation. First-line treatments of depression comprise serotonin\\nreuptake inhibitors, followed by serotonin-norepinephrine reup-\\ntake inhibitors, such as venlafaxine and duloxetine, tricyclic\\nantidepressants and mirtazapine [67].\\nPsychotherapy has long been considered an important treat-\\nment option for the management of depression in MS patients,\\nwith approaches focusing on coping skills showing superiority\\nover insight-oriented therapies [ 68]. In this view, cognitive\\nbehavior therapy can help maximize the development of the\\npatients’ coping skills [68]. The effectiveness of mindful-based\\nintervention which is based on the nonjudgmental awareness of\\neveryday moments has also been recently demonstrated [ 69].\\nHowever, these approaches cannot be used in cognitive impaired\\nMS patients [69].\\nRegarding non-pharmacological treatments, transcranial mag-\\nnetic stimulation is a recognized technique for the treatment of\\ncognitive and mood symptoms in depression [7].\\nAlthough no data are available for the treatment of MS\\ndepressive symptoms, by applying lesion network mapping, a\\nrecent study found that MS lesions associated with depression are\\nM.

This supports not only that\\nMS depression is associated with lesion location, but also that MS\\ndepression may share some neuroanatomical features with other\\ndepression etiologies and therapeutic neuromodulation sites.\\nThe association between disease modifying treatments (DMTs)\\nand mood disorders has been partially investigated. Early reports\\nsuggested an association between IFN-α, IFN-β and depression\\n[71]. While a randomized controlled trial comparing IFN-β and\\nglatiramer acetate showed no statistical differences between the\\ntwo treatment groups in terms of BDI scores [ 72], the EPOC\\n(Evaluate Patient Outcome) study showed that after switching\\nfrom injectable medications (i.e., IFN-β and glatiramer acetate) to\\nﬁngolimod BDI-II scores signi ﬁcantly reduced over a 6-month\\nperiod [73].\\nSome observational studies suggested a positive effect of\\nnatalizumab and ﬁngolimod on depression [74, 75], whereas the\\npossible interplay between depression and other DMTs such as\\ndimethyl fumarate, teriﬂunomide, alemtuzumab and ocrelizumab\\nhas not been studied yet.\\nAnxiety disorders\\nEpidemiological and clinical features. Anxiety disorders comprise\\nseparation anxiety and selective mutism, which occur primarily in\\nchildhood, speciﬁc phobias, social anxiety disorder, generalized\\nanxiety disorder, as well as panic disorder and agoraphobia,\\noccurring primarily in adulthood [76].\\nIndividuals with anxiety disorders are excessively fearful,\\nanxious, or avoidant of perceived threats in the environment or\\ninternal to oneself [77]. The response is out of proportion to the\\nactual risk or danger posed. Fear occurs because of perceived\\nimminent threat whereas anxiety is a state of anticipation about\\nperceived future threats. Panic attacks feature prominently as a\\nparticular type of fear response. Avoidance behaviors range from\\nrefusal to enter situations to subtle reliance on objects or people\\nto cope [77].\\nAnxiety disorders are common symptoms in MS, with an age-\\nstandardized prevalence reported up to 35.6% (95%\\nCI= 33.7–37.7%) of patients compared to 29.6% (95%\\nCI = 28.8–30.5%) in the general population [ 14]. MS patients\\nexperience anxiety disorders at some point during their lives,\\nhowever the prevalence peak is 45–59 years both in MS and in the\\ngeneral population [13, 14]. Anxiety disorders are often related to\\nfemale sex, a younger age [ 78], and a closer MS onset and\\ndiagnosis [79]. Indeed, MS diagnosis could be a risk factor to\\ndevelop anxiety disorders as the prevalence of self-reported\\nanxiety symptoms at time of MS onset is 2.7%, whereas it\\nbecomes 6.2% by the time of diagnosis [80].\\nSeveral studies investigated the association between anxiety\\nand cognitive functioning in MS [80–82], showing an association\\nbetween a worse performance on executive functioning, visual\\nmemory, and information processing speed and a higher level of\\nanxiety [81–83]. Moreover, MS patients with anxiety disorders\\nexperience signiﬁcantly more fatigue, pain and sleep problems,\\nwhich worsen with the co-occurrence of depression [84].\\nPathophysiology. The pathophysiology of anxiety disorders is\\npoorly understood in the general population, even less is known\\nin MS. In the general population, genetic-epidemiological studies\\nshowed a moderate familial aggregation for anxiety disorders,\\nwith heritability estimates in the range of 30–50% [85].\\nAs discussed below, several brain regions have been implicated\\nin the modulation of anxiety disorders both in general population\\nand MS, including amygdala, hippocampus and medial prefrontal\\ncortex (the ventromedial prefrontal and anterior cingulate\\ncortices). The involvement of hypothalamus, midbrain and\\nbrainstem has also been described.\\nAnxiety symptoms and the resulting disorders are thought to be\\ndue to disrupted modulation within the CNS. Several neurotrans-\\nmitter systems have been implicated to have a role in one or\\nseveral of the modulatory steps involved. A reduced activation of\\nthe serotonergic system and an over activation of the noradre-\\nnergic system have been described [86], resulting in dysregulation\\nof physiological arousal and the emotional experience of this\\narousal [86].\\nThe HPA axis has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of\\nanxiety disorders. Reduced ci rculating cortisol levels and\\nglucocorticoid hypersensitivi ty have been described in post-\\ntraumatic syndrome disorder [ 87]. Experimental studies have\\nalso showed that the HPA axis is hyperactivated in a wide range\\nof models of stress and anxiety [88]. In turn, these ﬁndings\\ns u p p o r tt h er o l eo fg l u c o c o r t i c o i d sa sc r u c i a lm e d i a t o r so f\\nfunctional and anatomical abnor malities observed in cortical\\nand limbic regions (acting through glucocorticoid and miner-\\nalocorticoid receptors) [89].\\nMRI ﬁndings. A few studies have investigated the association\\nbetween anxiety symptoms and measures of brain structural and\\nfunctional damage in MS patients with inconclusive results,\\nreﬂecting the complexity of the disease.\\nEarly studies showed no correlation between anxiety severity\\nscore and brain T2-hyperintense, T1-hypointense and gadolinium-\\nenhancing WM lesions [90–92]. Conversely, more recent evidence\\nrevealed that MS patients with fatigue and anxiety symptoms had\\nlarger caudate volumes and a thinner left parietal cortex\\ncompared to those without fatigue; another study showed that\\nMS-related anxiety may have its neuropathological substrate in\\nthe septo-fornical area [93]. The lack of de ﬁnite pathological\\nsubstrates leads to consider anxiety as a reactive response\\nfollowing disease progression [ 91]. However, a recent study\\nshowed that MS patients with higher anxiety severity score had\\nincreased atrophy in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, a crucial\\narea for top-down control for threat and emotional processing\\n[94], supporting a direct link between anxiety symptoms and\\nstructural damage [95].\\nAlthough anxiety has not been investigated in depth as\\ndepression in MS, several studies performed in people with\\ngeneralized anxiety disorder showed an involvement of speciﬁc\\nbrain regions. A large meta-analysis [ 96] revealed that only\\natrophy of the anterior cingulate and inferior frontal cortex was\\nassociated with anxiety symptoms in patients with anxiety\\ndisorders compared to healthy controls. Atrophy of the ventro-\\nmedial prefrontal cortex, a region associated with emotion and\\nreward in decision-making, has been also detected in patients\\nwith generalized anxiety disorders [97].\\nDiffusion tensor MRI studies also revealed widespread abnorm-\\nalities in regions involved in the generation and regulation of\\nemotion, such as amygdala [98], uncinate fasciculus and cingulum\\nin people with generalized anxiety disorder compared to healthy\\ncontrols [99, 100]. Notably, reduced fractional anisotropy values in\\nright uncinate fasciculus and left cingulum bundle showed\\nsigniﬁcantly negative correlations with anxiety severity score,\\nsupporting the involvement of these structures in anxiety\\ndisorders [100].\\nA recent RS FC study performed in MS patients identiﬁed an\\nanxiety-related network, compris ing bilateral prefrontal cortex,\\namygdala and hippocampus, which correlated to atrophy of the\\ndorsal pre-frontal cortex [95]. Interestingly, this network\\nresembles previously observed patterns of network-level dys-\\nfunction described for generalized anxiety disorders [101]. It is\\ntempting to speculate that the atrophy of the pre-frontal cortex\\nalters the functional connectivity to speci ﬁcb r a i na r e a s( i . e . ,\\namygdala and hippocampus) distal from the primary spot of\\natrophy leading to the loss of information input from a damaged\\npart of the brain [102].\\nM.

Indeed, so far, no controlled studies on\\nthe effectiveness of psychological or pharmacological treatments\\nof anxiety disorders were performed in MS patients, suggesting a\\nneed for research in this area. Only three clinical trials for\\ndepression evaluated the beneﬁcial effect of psychological\\ntreatment on MS-related anxiety, without showing any statistical\\nimprovement, probably due to the co-occurrence of depressive\\nsymptoms [104].\\nA few RCTs and observational studies evaluated the effect of\\nDMTs on anxiety symptoms. An improvement of anxiety\\nsymptoms was observed following both natalizumab and\\nﬁngolimod treatment, which was not statistically signi ﬁcant\\n[105–107].\\nCOGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT\\nEpidemiological and clinical features\\nCognitive impairment is a major cause of disability in MS with a\\nprevalence ranging between 34 and 91% according to the cohorts\\nof patients investigated, the neuropsychological tests used, and\\nthe criteria applied to deﬁne cognitive impairment, as explained\\nfurther below [108–111].\\nAlthough the pattern of cognitive de ﬁcits is highly variable\\namong MS patients, information processing speed, attention,\\nlearning, and memory are the most frequently involved domains,\\nwhereas deﬁcits in executive functions and visuospatial proces-\\nsing are also reported, but less frequently [2, 3, 32].\\nSex may in ﬂuence cognitive functions in MS [ 112–114].\\nCompared to females, male MS patients seem to be more\\nimpaired on several cognitive domains, including verbal memory,\\nexecutive functions, attention, memory, visuospatial processing,\\nand information processing speed [112–114].\\nCognitive impairment has been described in 20–25% of patients\\nwith clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 30–45% of patients with\\nrelapsing-remitting (RR) MS, and 50 –75% of patients with\\nsecondary progressive (SP) MS [115]. Although the prevalence of\\ncognitive impairment in primary progressive (PP) disease varies\\ngreatly, depending on the population considered, it occurs in up\\nto 91% of patients [108]. Cognitive dysfunction has been also\\ndescribed in subjects with a radiologically isolated syndrome [RIS]\\n[116], where MRIﬁndings suggestive of MS are incidentally found\\nin an asymptomatic subject. In particular, cognitive deﬁcits can\\nprecede the appearance of other neurological symptoms and\\nsigns and are associated inﬂammatory-demyelinating lesions of\\nthe CNS seen on MRI [109, 116]. Cognitive deﬁcits have been also\\nfound in more than 50% of patients with pediatric-onset MS, i.e., in\\nthose patients where the clinical onset of the disease occurs\\nbefore the age of 18 years. These patients are characterized by\\nworse performance in information processing speed and memory\\nas well as verbal intelligence compared to age-matched healthy\\ncontrols [117]. Decreased intelligence quotient and academic skills\\nhave also been described [118]. It is likely that inﬂammation of the\\nbrain during critical developmental periods [ 119], including\\nmyelinogenesis in adolescence, may irreparably damage neural\\nnetworks involved in such domains [120].\\nSeveral test batteries have been recommended and validated to\\nexplore cognitive performance in MS patients [121]. While the\\nmore lengthy and complex Brief Repeatable Battery-\\nNeuropsychology (BRB-N, 45 min) and MACFIMS (Minimal\\nAssessment of Cognitive Function in Multiple Sclerosis, 90 min)\\nare usually applied in research settings, a shorter assessment, such\\nas the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for multiple\\nsclerosis (BICAMS) [122], or the assessment of only information\\nprocessing speed using the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)\\n[123], may be more appropriate for clinical use (Table1). While\\nMACFIMS has a stronger psychometric foundation compared to\\nBRB-N and includes assessment of spatial processing and higher\\nexecutive function abilities, both tests provide information\\nregarding working memory, executive functions and verbal\\nﬂuency compared to BICAMS (Table1).\\nInterestingly, some longitudinal studies with a long follow-up\\nprovided important insights into the pattern of cognitive evolution in\\nMS. Two of these studies observed deterioration in simple and\\ncomplex auditory attention span and episodic verbal learning and\\nmemory, with one showing additional worsening in visuospatial\\nmemory, whereas the other found additional deterioration in\\ninformation processing speed and visual construction [124, 125].\\nThe third study showed signiﬁcant deterioration only in information\\nprocessing speed and complex attention [126].\\nRecently, the traditional dichotomous classiﬁcation of cognitive\\nfunctioning, namely, preserved vs impaired cognition, has been\\nchallenged. Indeed, by applying different methodologies, such as\\nmachine learning or more classiﬁcation-style approaches (e.g.,\\nInternational Classiﬁcation of Cognitive Disorders in Epilepsy; IC-\\nCoDE), recent studies have examined cognitive impairment in MS\\nby identifying distinctive cognitive phenotypes [127–130]. These\\nstudies identiﬁed from three to ﬁve phenotypes, highlighting a\\nspectrum of cognitive function ranging from intact to a multi-\\ndomain impairment [127–130]. Compared to the dichotomous\\nclassiﬁcation of cognitive impairment, the deﬁnition of speciﬁc\\ncognitive phenotypes may represent a step toward tailored\\ntreatment approaches and toward improving understanding of\\nthe different pathophysiological mechanisms related to cognitive\\nchanges in MS.\\nNotably, the revised ﬁfth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical\\nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) proposed a common framework\\nfor the diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders, including mild and\\nmajor neurocognitive disorders [131]. Brieﬂy, the DSM-5 diagnosis of\\nmajor neurocognitive disorder requires substantial impairment to be\\npresent in one or (usually) more cognitive domains, and this must be\\nsufﬁcient to interfere with independence in everyday activities. The\\ndiagnosis of mild neurocognitive disorder is made when there is\\nmodest impairment in one or more cognitive domains and the\\nindividual is still independent in everyday activities, albeit with\\ngreater effort. The impairment must represent a decline from a\\npreviously higher level and should be documented both by history\\nand by objective assessment. Further, the cognitive deﬁcits must not\\noccur exclusively in the context of a delirium or be better explained\\nby another mental disorder.\\nThe DSM‐5 classiﬁcation was designed to complement the\\nclinical process in which a diagnosis is made in two steps: a\\nsyndromal diagnosis is made ﬁrst, and then potential causative\\nfactors are examined to attribute etiology [131].

Th is emphasizes the role of\\nadditional factors, including brain reserve and cognitive\\nreserve [3].\\nThe brain reserve hypothesis states that people with higher\\nbrain reserve withstand more severe disease burden before\\nexperiencing cognitive decline [132]. Brain reserve is attained\\nduring the critical period of the human development and refers\\nto structural characteristics (i.e., maximal lifetime brain growth)\\n[132]. Intracranial volume (ICV) is an estimate of maximal\\nlifetime brain growth, as brain growth corresponds to increased\\nICV during development [ 133]. MS patients with higher ICV\\nshowed better cognitive scoresin the SDMT and Paced Auditory\\nSerial Addition Task-3 (PASAT-3) measures compared to those\\nwith lower ICV [134]. Of note, this protective effect was speciﬁc\\nfor these cognitive domains and was not related to memory\\nfunctions [134].\\nThe cognitive reserve hypothesis [132, 134, 135] relies on the\\nevidence that daily-life activities and increased intellectual\\nenrichment, such as vocabulary, literacy, intelligence, education,\\nwork and engagement in cognitive enriching leisure activities,\\nmay mitigate the negative effect of disease-related structural\\ndamage on cognitive status, particularly memory abilities\\n[134, 136–139]. A protective effect was observed for life\\nexperience (i.e., early life cognitive leisure) and education,\\nindependently from ICV [134]. Different studies showed that both\\nRRMS [140, 141] and SPMS patients [142] with higher intellectual\\nenrichment were less likely to suffer disease-related cognitive\\nimpairment. Notably, the potential protective role of cognitive\\nreserve against cognitive dysfunction was also evident in pediatric\\nMS [143]. In these patients, higher intelligence quotient scores\\nwere associated with stable or improved cognitive performance at\\nsubsequent evaluations, particularly in cognitively-preserved\\nsubjects at theﬁrst assessment [ 143]. These positive effects\\nappeared to be maintained during adulthood [144, 145]. There-\\nfore, cognitive reserve could be particularly efﬁcient in children,\\nwho may have greater capacity to compensate from brain\\ndamage through neural plasticity.\\nIn this view, cognitive impairment is more prevalent in older MS\\npatients compared to younger patients [146]. Some evidence also\\nsuggested that male patients had more vulnerability to cognitive\\ndeﬁcits compared to female patients in MS [147].\\nSince cognitive reserve is potentially a modiﬁable factor, its\\nenhancement through physical exercise, mentally active lifestyles,\\nmanagement of cardiovascular risk factors and other comorbid-\\nities, might be a therapeutic target to prevent or slow cognitive\\ndeterioration in MS patients [148].\\nFig. 1 Schematic representation of the main substrates underlying cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis.WM and GM damage (i.e.,\\nfocal lesions and subtle abnormalities in normal-appearing brain tissues), and functional abnormalities, especially in strategic regions, can\\nexplain the presence and severity of cognitive impairment.

Disconnection mechanisms have been\\nsuggested to contribute to cognitive impairment in MS patients,\\nthrough the disruption of integration between different cogni-\\ntively relevant brain regions [3].\\nConsistently with this hypoth esis, correlative clinical–lesional\\nstudies have demonstrated that brain T2-hyperintense WM LV and\\nthe location of lesions in cognitively-relevant WM tracts or regions\\nhelp to explain global cognitive dysfunction as well as deﬁcits in\\nspeciﬁc cognitive domains in MS patients [3, 149, 150]. A structural\\nconnectivity disruption was observed in RRMS patients within visual\\nnetwork, between visual and deep GM networks, and between\\ndefault mode and frontoparietal networks, and correlated with worse\\nworking memory [151]. In another study, a close correlation between\\nlower information processing speedand higher structural disconnec-\\ntion in the default mode network was found in RRMS patients with\\nand without cognitive impairment, being more pronounced in the\\nformer group [152]. Worse executive control in RRMS patients\\ncorrelated with higher structural disconnection in the frontoparietal\\nnetworks, deep GM structures and insula [ 153], and within\\nsensorimotor, dorsal attention, left frontoparietal, and default mode\\nnetworks [154].\\nMoreover, the severity of lesional microstructural abnormalities in\\nWM tracts that are critical for cognitive functions, such as the\\ncingulum, were also found to be relevant predictors of global\\ncognitive impairment and of deﬁcits in single cognitive domains\\n[155].\\nIn addition to focal WM lesions, diffuse NAWM damage may also\\nundermine the physiological co nnections among cognitively-\\nrelevant GM regions, contributing to a disconnection syndrome.\\nUsing diffusion tensor MRI, performance at global cognitive functions\\nand at speciﬁc cognitive domains, including information processing\\nspeed, attention, memory, verbalﬂuency and executive functions,\\nhave been consistently found to be associated with microstructural\\nabnormalities in relevant WM tracts, such as the corpus callosum,\\ncingulum, fornix and thalamic connections [155–166]. Interestingly,\\nthese abnormalities partially overlapped with brain T2-hyperintense\\nWM lesions, supporting an independent role of NAWM damage in\\ndetermining cognitive impairment [162, 163, 165].\\nFocal and diffuse GM damage has been consistently identiﬁed\\namong the best predictors of cognitive de ﬁcits. Using double\\ninversion recovery (DIR) sequence, higher number and volume of\\ncortical lesions, especially in the hippocampus, were found to be\\nsigniﬁcantly associated with the severity of cognitive dysfunction\\n[167–169] and to predict worsening of cognitive performance over 5\\nyears [170]. Moreover, more severe atrophy and microstructural\\nabnormalities of cognitively-relevant GM regions such as the\\nthalamus, hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum have been consis-\\ntently identiﬁed among the best contributors of worse cognitive\\nperformance in MS patients wit h the main disease clinical\\nphenotypes [171–176], and to predict cognitive deterioration over\\nup to 13 years [177, 178].\\nA few studies have analyzed the relationship between distinct\\ncognitive deﬁcits (e.g., memory or visuospatial impairment) and\\nregional cortical atrophy in MS. These studies usually included\\nrelatively small samples or focused on speciﬁc tests or brain regions,\\nwith conﬂicting results. While a study showed no signi ﬁcant\\ncorrelation between SDMT and regional brain volumes [179], more\\nrecent studies revealed an assoc iation with prefrontal cortex,\\nprecentral and postcentral gyri, and right temporal cortex [180]a s\\nwell as thalamus, cerebellum, putamen, and occipital cortex [181].\\nSo far, a few studies have investigated the differences of structural\\nbrain damage between males and female MS patients in cognitive\\nimpairment. Some studies suggested that more severe NAWM\\nmicrostructural abnormalities [112] and subcortical GM atrophy [113]\\nin male compared to female MS patients are two relevant\\npathological substrates contributing to sex-related differences in\\ncognitive impairment in MS. In a recent study [182], worse cognitive\\nperformance seemed to be associated mainly with deep GM volume\\nloss in female MS patients, and with cortical GM volume loss in male\\nMS patients.\\nFunctional brain MRI. Beside structural damage, fMRI studies may\\nprovide relevant pieces of information about the substrates\\nunderpinning cognitive impairment. MS patients without cogni-\\ntive impairment have consistently shown increased and more\\nwidely distributed cortical recruitment than healthy controls\\nduring the performance of cognitive tasks [158, 183, 184]. These\\nfunctional abnormalities are associated with measures of brain\\nstructural damage (i.e., brain T2-hyperintense WM LV, NAWM and\\nGM damage) [158] and suggest that the increased activation\\nduring a task of crucial cortical regions/networks might represent\\nadaptive processes able to attenuate the negative effect of MS-\\nrelated tissue damage on cognitive function. However, such\\nincreased cortical recruitment cannot persist indeﬁnitely, and the\\nloss or exhaustion of adaptive mechanisms might contribute to\\ncognitive decline [185–187].\\nAnother mechanism that has been disclosed in MS patients\\nwhen applying active fMRI tasks is the inability to optimize\\ncognitive network recruitment with increasing task dif ﬁculty,\\nwhich results from an impaired functional reserve (the ability to\\nmatch brain activity to increasing cognitive demand) [188, 189].\\nThis maladaptive mechanism contributes to the clinical\\nmanifestations of the disease, is more pronounced in patients\\nwith SPMS [189] and in those with cognitive impairment [190].\\nThe network compensation-c ollapse hypothesis has been\\nproven also using an analysis of RS FC. In the earliest phases of\\nthe disease and in MS patients without cognitive impairment,\\nbetter cognitive performance was associated with increased RS\\nFC among several regions of several brain networks, such as the\\nattention network [191, 192]. On the other hand, in MS patients\\nwith cognitive impairment, more heterogeneous and inefﬁcient\\npatterns of RS FC abnormalities have been found. Indeed,\\nreduced RS FC of anterior regions of the brain, mostly located in\\nthe frontal lobes [ 193, 194], associated with more severe\\ncognitive impairment and with structural disruption of the\\nconnecting WM tracts [193], but also increased RS FC associated\\nwith worse cognitive performance [195, 196].\\nCognitive functions are complex brain processes based on\\nlocal processing and effective integration among different\\nregions. Accordingly, pathological processes can determine\\ncognitive dysfunction throug had i r e c ti n v o l v e m e n to fG M\\nregions relevant for cognitive fu nctions and the disruption of\\ntheir connections. Consistentl y with this hypothesis, multi-\\nparametric MRI studies have fu rther supported a complimen-\\ntary and independent contribution of focal WM lesions, NAWM\\nmicrostructural damage and G M atrophy, combined with\\nfunctional brain network abnormalities, to cognitive impair-\\nment in MS patients [164, 165, 197–200]. At present, only two\\nlongitudinal studies [ 187, 201] have employed both structural\\nand functional MRI techniques, ﬁnding an association between\\ncortical [201] and deep GM atrophy, maladaptive excessive and\\ninefﬁcient recruitment of brain networks and worse cognitive\\nperformances over time [187, 201].\\nRecent work also pointed out an involvement of speci ﬁc\\nneurotransmitter systems to explain cognitive impairment in\\nMS patients. In line with this, compared to cognitively\\npreserved MS patients, those with cognitive impairment\\nshowed signiﬁcant GM atrophy that was spatially correlated\\nwith a higher atlas-based distribution of speci ﬁcr e c e p t o ro r\\ntransporter of dopamine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine and\\nglutamate. Although these studies did not directly explore the\\nimpairment of speciﬁc neurotransmitters networks, these\\nresults suggested that cognitive impairment may be associated\\nwith a pattern of GM atrophy that is not random and involves\\nregions with a high and speciﬁc distribution of\\nM.

Notably, such beneﬁcial effects\\nmay occur also in MS patients with a progressive disease course\\nand more severe cognitive impairment, suggesting that, beyond\\ntheir effect in reducing disease activity, DMTs can improve or, at\\nleast stabilize, cognitive functions [202].\\nCognitive rehabilitation [203–205] and symptomatic treatments\\n[206] may also contribute to preserve and improve cognitive\\nfunctions in MS patients.\\nCognitive rehabilitation typically refers to training targeting\\nimprovement of skill by regaining (re-establishing or strengthen-\\ning) abilities that were intact prior to the loss. The other focus of\\ncognitive rehabilitation is developing compensatory strategies for\\nlost abilities when they cannot be regained. In contrast, the term\\ncognitive intervention refers to targeted training of a particular\\ncognitive skill or domain for the purpose of enhancement\\nregardless of the baseline state of cognitive abilities [ 203].\\nHistorically, most of the measures implemented for use involved\\nlearning and memory-based interventions, but recently the focus\\nhas moved to executive function and attention, since these are\\nthe cognitive domains most affected in MS [203].\\nConﬂicting ﬁndings about the effectiveness of the various\\ncognitive rehabilitation techniques exist and therefore no deﬁnite\\nconclusions can be drawn about their effect on cognition. Two\\nCochrane reviews assessing 20 randomized controlled trials of\\nbehavioral interventions [205] and 15 interventional trials pointed\\nout the low bene ﬁcial effects of rehabilitation on cognitive\\nfunctioning. A separate systematic review evaluating 33 original\\nintervention studies supported similar conclusions [203]. However,\\nthese ﬁndings may be limited by the evaluation of small samples\\nof subjects or methodological biases; thus, future research should\\nbe devoted to better understating the potential beneﬁts of such\\ntherapies. It is worth mentioning that a randomized clinical trial\\nwith a combined approach of cognitive rehabilitation and aerobic\\nexercise is ongoing [207].\\nSimilarly, at present there is insufﬁcient evidence to support the\\nuse of symptomatic pharmacologic treatments (i.e., donepezil,\\nrivastigmine, memantine) to improve cognitive function in people\\nwith MS [206, 208].\\nHowever, a multiparametric combined approach including\\nDMTs, symptomatic therapies, rehabilitation together with the\\nadoption of a healthy lifestyle (i.e., physical exercise, mental\\nactivity, prevention of cardiovascular disease and other comorbid-\\nities, smoking cessation, etc.) may be the most rewarding strategy\\nto preserve cognitive integrity and to recover cognitive functions\\nin MS patients showing cognitive deﬁcits [148].\\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms are frequently reported in MS\\npatients. Among them, cognitive impairment, clinical depression\\nand anxiety are the most common with a higher frequency in MS\\npatients compared to the general population [4]. These symptoms\\nmay develop even before the diagnosis of MS [209], and, hence,\\nearly diagnosis is crucial to prevent complications. Although an\\nimproved understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms\\nunderlying these conditions has led to the development of several\\nneuropsychological batteries and scales to better identify these\\nsymptoms, deﬁnite treatment guidelines still not exist in MS.\\nFurther studies are needed to clarify the complex interplay\\nbetween MS and neuropsychiatric disorders, especially the\\ninﬂuence of factors such as sex, lesion location, involvement of\\nneuroendocrine factors and possible side effects related to DMTs.\\nFinally, larger RCTs may shed light on the effectiveness of\\npharmacological therapy and psychotherapy in MS patients with\\nneuropsychiatric symptoms.\\nREFERENCES\\n1.

This study addresses the relative contribution of relapses to disability worsen-\\ning over the course of the disease, how early progression begins and the extent to which multiple sclerosis therapies\\ndelay disability accumulation.\\nUsing the Novartis-Oxford multiple sclerosis (NO.MS) data pool spanning all multiple sclerosis phenotypes and\\npaediatric multiple sclerosis, we evaluated ≏ 200 000 Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) transitions from\\n>27 000 patients with≤15 years follow-up. We analysed three datasets: (i) A full analysis dataset containing all obser-\\nvational and randomized controlled clinical trials in which disability and relapses were assessed (n = 27 328); (ii) all\\nphase 3 clinical trials (n = 8346); and (iii) all placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trials (n = 4970). We determined the\\nrelative importance of RAW and PIRA, investigated the role of relapses on all-cause disability worsening using\\nAndersen-Gill models and observed the impact of the mechanism of worsening and disease-modifying therapies\\non the time to reach milestone disability levels using time continuous Markov models.\\nPIRA started early in the disease process, occurred in all phenotypes and became the principal driver of disability\\naccumulation in the progressive phase of the disease. Relapses signiﬁcantly increased the hazard of all-cause dis-\\nability worsening events; following a year in which relapses occurred (versus a year without relapses), the hazard\\nincreased by 31–48% (all P < 0.001). Pre-existing disability and older age were the principal risk factors for incom-\\nplete relapse recovery. For placebo-treated patients with minimal disability (EDSS 1), it took 8.95 years until in-\\ncreased limitation in walking ability (EDSS 4) and 18.48 years to require walking assistance (EDSS 6). Treating\\npatients with disease-modifying therapies delayed these times signiﬁcantly by 3.51 years (95% conﬁdence limit:\\n3.19, 3.96) and 3.09 years (2.60, 3.72), respectively. In patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, those\\nwho worsened exclusively due to RAW events took a similar length of time to reach milestone EDSS values com-\\npared with those with PIRA events; the fastest transitions were observed in patients with PIRA and superimposed\\nrelapses.\\nOur data conﬁrm that relapses contribute to the accumulation of disability, primarily early in multiple sclerosis.\\nPIRA begins in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and becomes the dominant driver of disability accumulation\\nas the disease evolves. Pre-existing disability and older age are the principal risk factors for further disability ac-\\ncumulation. The use of disease-modifying therapies delays disability accrual by years, with the potential to gain\\ntime being highest in the earliest stages of multiple sclerosis.\\n1 The Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for Multiple Sclerosis, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,\\nNew York, NY, USA\\nReceived September 24, 2021.

The clinical distinction of re-\\nlapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis has recently been\\nchallenged: In a study by Kapposet al.1 including pooled data from two\\nlarge phase 3 clinical trials in relapsing multiple sclerosis, most dis-\\nability accumulation was not associated with overt relapses. The\\nstudy used a composite end point of walking ability, hand coordin-\\nation, and physical disability for the detection of PIRA events. The ex-\\ntent to which thisﬁnding reﬂects the pathophysiology of multiple\\nsclerosis, rather than the particular deﬁnitions of relapse and progres-\\nsion used in the Kapposet al.1 study, warrants further exploration in a\\nlarge independent dataset with more stringent deﬁnitions of PIRA.\\nWhile the role of clinical relapses in diagnosis is undisputed, and\\ntheir impact on the patient’s quality of life is undeniable, the involve-\\nment of clinical relapse in long-term prognosis has been ques-\\ntioned.2,3 In natural history studies, patients with and without\\nrelapses progressed similarly and so a common mechanism of pro-\\ngression independent of relapses was suggested.4 However, more re-\\ncent population-based studies have conﬁrmed relapses play a role in\\nthe transition time from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis\\n(RRMS) to SPMS (with poor recovery from relapses and high frequency\\nof early relapses reducing the time to onset of progressive disease),5,6\\nin the accumulation of disability both in early and later RRMS,7–10 and\\neven in progressive disease.11 The quantitative relevance of relapses\\nand progression in driving the accumulation of disability in the differ-\\nent stages of multiple sclerosis therefore requires further study.\\nRelapses and focal inﬂammation are predominantly a feature of\\nyoung patients with multiple sclerosis. Paediatric multiple sclerosis\\nis almost exclusively of the relapsing subtype,12,13 with relapse\\nrates being two to three times higher in paediatric-onset than\\nadult-onset multiple sclerosis.14 In adult patients with RRMS,\\nrelapse frequency is highest in the youngest patients15 and de-\\ncreases with age, even in placebo-treated patients.16 Current ther-\\napies for multiple sclerosis primarily target focal inﬂammation,\\nand consequently their relative effect is strongest in patients where\\ninﬂammation is most prominent, i.e. in young patients with mul-\\ntiple sclerosis.15,16 However, the extent to which disease-modifying\\ntherapies (DMTs) impact long-term outcomes and prolong the time\\nto milestone disability levels is a question not fully answered.\\nThe Novartis-Oxford multiple sclerosis (NO.MS) dataset is an\\nideal dataset in which to investigate the mechanisms of disability ac-\\nquisition. It is currently the largest, most comprehensive clinical trial\\ndataset in multiple sclerosis, spanning all phenotypes and contain-\\ning data from≏ 35 000 patients with up to 15 years of follow-up,\\nwith regular monitoring of patients’neurological status by trained\\nand certiﬁed raters and the inclusion of randomized placebo-\\ncontrolled trials across all stages of multiple sclerosis.16 Here, using\\na large subset of NO.MS data with longitudinal evaluations of disabil-\\nity and relapses, we quantify all conﬁrmed disability worsening\\n(CDW) events, and we investigate the mechanisms of disability ac-\\ncrual, i.e. RAW versus PIRA, across all multiple sclerosis phenotypes.\\nThis study examines the role of clinical relapses in driving disease\\nworsening and estimates the extent to which DMTs can alter the dis-\\nease course and prolong the time to milestone disability levels.\\nMaterials and methods\\nData sources\\nAll analyses were based on data from 23 Novartis multiple sclerosis\\nclinical trials, plus their extensions, that collected longitudinal dis-\\nability [measured by Kurtzke’s17 Expanded Disability Status\\nScale; EDSS) and relapse assessments, and formed part of the\\nNO.MS dataset.16 An overview of the contributing studies can be\\nfound inSupplementary Table 1.

All\\npatients provided written informed consent. All clinical and MRI\\nscan data have been anonymized.18 The individual study results\\nhave been previously published elsewhere.\\nEnd point deﬁnitions\\nMultiple sclerosis relapses\\nMultiple sclerosis relapses were deﬁned as the appearance of a new\\nneurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or im-\\nproving pre-existing neurological abnormality (present for at least\\n24 h in the absence of fever or known infection), separated by at\\nleast 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical demyelinating event\\npresent for at least 24 h. Conﬁrmed multiple sclerosis relapses were\\ndeﬁned as those accompanied by a clinically relevant change in\\nEDSS (e.g. an increase in EDSS score of at least 0.5 points) or func-\\ntional scores (excluding bowel/bladder or cerebral scores) and con-\\nﬁrmed programmatically and centrally in the NO.MS database. All\\nstudies collected investigator-reported relapses. Unless speciﬁcally\\nnoted, all investigator-reported relapses are included in the\\nstatistical analyses (irrespective of whether the relapse was\\nEDSS-conﬁrmed or not).\\nConﬁrmed and sustained disability worsening\\nCDW events were based on EDSS and deﬁned by an increase in\\nEDSS (either≥1.5 points for patients with a baseline EDSS of zero,\\n≥1.0 point for patients with a baseline EDSS of 1–5 and by 0.5 points\\nfor patients with a baseline EDSS of≥5.5; Supplementary Table 2A)\\nconﬁrmed by an EDSS assessment at least 3 or 6 months (3-month\\nor 6-month CDW) apart from the onset of the worsening (and sus-\\ntained in all intermediate EDSS assessments, if any).\\nWhere applicable, we categorized CDW events as either RAW or\\nPIRA. It is possible for patients to experience sequential RAW and\\nPIRA events. Moreover, some CDW events did not fulﬁll either the\\ncriteria of RAW or PIRA and were left unclassiﬁed. The following de-\\nﬁnitions were used:\\n(i) RAW was a 3- or 6-month CDW event with an onset within 90 days from\\nthe onset of an investigator-reported relapse (irrespective of the EDSS\\nconﬁrmation).\\n(ii) PIRA was deﬁned as a 3- or 6-month CDW event with either no prior re-\\nlapse or an onset more than 90 days after the start date of the last\\ninvestigator-reported relapse (irrespective of the EDSS conﬁrmation). In\\naddition, to qualify as a PIRA event, no relapse must occur within 30\\ndays before or after the EDSS conﬁrmation. If a relapse with incomplete re-\\ncovery occurred, the baseline (i.e. the reference EDSS value) was reset >90\\ndays after the relapse onset to identify the next PIRA event. In an individ-\\nual patient, the baseline could be reset multiple times (i.e. after each re-\\nlapse) until either a PIRA event was discovered, or until the individual\\nEDSS proﬁle ended.\\n(iii) Sustained PIRA was a 3- or 6-month PIRA event in which the\\nEDSS-worsening was sustained in all following assessments, i.e. the pa-\\ntient never recovered in the available longitudinal data.\\nMore detailed end point de ﬁnitions may be found in\\nSupplementary Table 2B, withFig. 1providing a schematic of the\\nRAW and PIRA deﬁnitions.\\nStatistical analyses\\nEuler diagrams (adapted from Kapposet al.1) by multiple sclerosis\\nphenotype (RRMS, SPMS or PPMS) for all three datasets and\\nfor paediatric patients (as a model of‘pure’RRMS, with a prepon-\\nderance of focal inﬂammatory events) were used (i) to quantify\\nthe mechanisms of clinical disease worsening; and (ii) to determine\\nthe effect of DMTs on the mechanisms of clinical disease\\nworsening.\\nWe compared on-study MRI activity between patients with RAW\\nand patients with PIRA events, based on the number (negative\\nbinomial model) and the percentage of patients free of gadolinium\\n(Gd)-enhancing T1 lesions in each multiple sclerosis phenotype.\\nThe prognostic value of recent relapses (within 1 year or the last\\n2 years) for subsequent all-cause 6-month CDW was analysed using\\nAndersen-Gill models. The null hypothesis was tested that relapses\\nhave no prognostic value for future disability worsening.

EDSS measures taken during a relapse (as judged\\nby the treating physician) were omitted.21 The Markov Models in-\\ncluded ‘age’and ‘treatment’as covariates because the distribution\\nof EDSS scores and transition probabilities have a strong depend-\\nence on age and potentially on treatment.‘Treatment’was coded\\nas (yes = any DMTs; no = no DMT).

Patients\\ndiagnosed with RRMS were younger, had a higher level of clinical\\nand MRI disease activity and were less disabled at baseline compared\\nwith SPMS patients, while patients with a diagnosis of progressive\\nmultiple sclerosis (either SPMS or PPMS) were in their late 40s and\\nshowed lower levels of acute inﬂammation at baseline. Only 22% of\\nRRMS and SPMS patients were treatment-naïve at baseline (Table 1).\\nMechanisms of disability worsening: RAW and PIRA\\nRelapses during the study were most common in RRMS, followed by\\nSPMS, and least common (but still occurred) in PPMS patients in\\nboth the full dataset and in the phase 3 trials (Fig. 2A). The risk of\\nan all-cause disability worsening (6-month CDW) event was higher\\nin progressive than relapsing multiple sclerosis in both in the\\nfull dataset (PPMS: 320/986 = 32.5%; SPMS: 373/1873 = 19.9%; and\\nRRMS: 1761/24 469 = 7.2%) and in the phase 3 trials (PPMS: 320/970\\n= 33.0%; SPMS: 354/1753 = 20.2%; and RRMS: 611/5623 = 10.9%).\\nIn the full dataset and the phase 3 trials, as predicted,\\nrelapse-associated disability worsening (out of all 6-month CDW\\nevents) occurred more frequently in RRMS than SPMS and least fre-\\nquently in PPMS (Fig. 2A). However, unexpectedly, PIRA had already\\nbegun in adult patients with RRMS: Sustained PIRA events occurred\\nwith similar or higher frequency to RAW events in adult patients\\nwith RRMS (in the full dataset RAW versus PIRA: 474 versus 833/\\n1761; 26.9 versus 47.3%; and in the phase 3 dataset RAW versus\\nPIRA: 200 versus 211/611; 32.7 versus 34.5%, respectively). The re-\\nmaining 454 CDW events in the full dataset, and 200 CDW events\\nin the phase 3 trials, could not be classiﬁed as either RAW or sus-\\ntained PIRA according to our deﬁnitions (note that the unclassiﬁed\\nevents include 6-month conﬁrmed PIRA events that were not sus-\\ntained in the longitudinal follow-up data; these have not been\\ncounted as PIRA events, differing from the deﬁnition used by\\nKappos et al.1). The number of sustained and unstained PIRA events\\nare tabulated inSupplementary Table 3: In RRMS, proportionally\\nmore 6-month conﬁrmed PIRA events were not sustained (i.e.\\nRRMS patients recovered at some stage), while in progressive mul-\\ntiple sclerosis the vast majority of 6-month conﬁrmed PIRA events\\nwere sustained in the longitudinal data.\\nIn the full dataset, sustained PIRA occurred across all multiple\\nsclerosis phenotypes and meaningfully contributed to the overall\\nclinical worsening of patients (sustained PIRA/6-month CDW\\nevents: RRMS, 833/1761 = 47.3%; SPMS, 286/373 = 76.7%; and PPMS,\\n267/320 = 83.4%). Similarly, in the phase 3 trials, sustained PIRA\\nevents occurred in all phenotypes (sustained PIRA/6-month CDW\\nevents: RRMS, 211/611 = 34.5%; SPMS, 275/354 = 77.7%; and PPMS,\\n267/320 = 83.4%). In the full dataset, the 6-month conﬁrmed PIRA\\nevents were mostly sustained until the end of the follow-up data\\nin all phenotypes, with the proportion of sustained PIRA events\\nbeing highest in progressive multiple sclerosis (sustained PIRA/\\n6-month PIRA events: PPMS, 267/310 = 86.1%; SPMS, 286/307 =\\n93.2%; and RRMS, 833/1175= 70.9%;Supplementary Table 3). In the\\nphase 3 dataset, corresponding numbers for sustained PIRA/6-month\\nPIRA events were: PPMS, 267/310 = 86.1%; SPMS, 275/295 = 93.2%; and\\nRRMS, 211/394 = 53.6%.\\nA minority of patients with RRMS experienced sustained PIRA\\nevents and thus fulﬁlled the deﬁnition of SPMS: in the full dataset,\\nthese were 833 out of 24 469 patients (3.4%), which is broadly con-\\nsistent with the corresponding numbers from the clinical phase 3\\nstudies (211/5623 = 3.8%;Fig. 2A).

In the full dataset and for the subset of patients from phase 3 clinical trials, progression and relapse onset was restricted to the ﬁrst 2\\nyears of the trials. Six-month CDW was used in adult patients. Three-month CDW was used in paediatric patients, as the mean study duration was 20\\nversus 17 months for patients treated withﬁngolimod or interferon beta-1a, respectively. PIRA events were 6-month or 3-month conﬁrmed and sus-\\ntained until the end of the follow-up time in adult and paediatric patients, respectively.

The data show that DMTs reduced the pro-\\nportions of patients who relapsed and those who had all-cause dis-\\nability worsening events, with the strongest effect in RRMS. In\\nactively-treated patients with RRMS, 181/1582 = 11.4% experienced\\na 6-month CDW event compared with 134/773 = 17.3% of placebo-\\ntreated patients. In SPMS, 203/1099 = 18.5% of the DMT-treated pa-\\ntients experienced a 6-month CDW event compared with 124/546\\n= 22.7% of placebo-treated patients. In PPMS, corresponding num-\\nbers were 155/483 = 32.1% versus 165/487 = 33.9%.\\nIn patients treated with any DMTs, compared with placebo, pro-\\nportionally more of the 6-month CDW events were sustained PIRA\\nevents, most notably in RRMS: 65/181 6-month CDW (35.9%) in the\\nactive arms versus 27/134 (20.0%) in the placebo arms. Similarly, in\\npatients with SPMS, the number of sustained PIRA events out of all\\n6-month CDW events was 162/203 (79.8%) in the active arms versus\\n92/124 (74.2%) in the placebo arms. In PPMS the vast majority of\\n6-month CDW events were sustained PIRA; corresponding num-\\nbers were 126/155 (81.3%) in DMT-treated versus 141/165 (85.5%)\\nin placebo-treated patients.\\nA similar, but more pronounced pattern was seen in paediatric\\npatients (Fig. 2C). In interferon beta-1a treated patients, all patients\\nwho had a CDW event also relapsed during the study; only a single\\npatient had worsening that fulﬁlled the de ﬁnition of PIRA.\\nThe more efﬁcacious treatment (ﬁngolimod compared with inter-\\nferon beta-1a) reduced the proportion of patients who relapsed (ﬁn-\\ngolimod: 24/107 = 22.4% versus interferon beta-1a: 67/107 = 62.6%)\\nand also reduced all-cause 3-month CDW events (ﬁngolimod: 4/\\n107 = 3.7% versus interferon beta-1a: 12/107 = 11.2%). However, in\\nﬁngolimod-treated patients, only 2/4 (50%) of the CDW events\\nwere RAW, while 2/4 (50%) events occurred in the absence of any re-\\nported relapses; one of them was a sustained PIRA event (no re-\\nlapses and no new lesions were detected in that patient), the\\nsecond was a worsening that occurred in the absence of any re-\\nported relapse activity, but the patient recovered (i.e. an unclassiﬁ-\\nable event).\\nThe role of relapses in driving disease worsening and\\nprogression in multiple sclerosis\\nRelapses in the previous study year, at any time and across all pheno-\\ntypes, increased the risk for a subsequent all-cause CDW event, with\\nmarked signiﬁcance and consistently, by 31–48% across the three da-\\ntasets (Table 2). The prognostic value of relapses 1 year prior (i.e. the\\nannualized relapse rate-1 year) was similar or higher (based on a\\nlikelihood-ratio test) than that of relapses in the previous 2 years\\n(i.e. the annualized relapse rate-2 years) in all three datasets.\\nOther risk factors for 6-month CDW included pre-existing disabil-\\nity (i.e. the higher the level of disability, the more likely a further wor-\\nsening), male sex and a diagnosis of progressive multiple sclerosis\\n(either SPMS or PPMS). The impact of these additional risk factors is\\nillustrated for each of the three datasets inSupplementary Fig. 1.\\nRelapses and relapse recovery\\nRisk factors for an incomplete recovery from relapse were investi-\\ngated as contributors to the accumulation of disability. Overall,\\n15 921 relapses were reported in RRMS patients, 556 in SPMS and\\n115 in PPMS; this included all investigator-reported relapses, irre-\\nspective of an EDSS-based conﬁrmation; the recovery from relapse\\nwas assessed as per the investigator’s judgement.\\nThe functional systems affected by relapses in patients with\\nRRMS and SPMS are summarized inFig. 3. In patients with early\\nRRMS and only mild disability (EDSS≤2), sensory and pyramidal\\nfunctional systems were most commonly affected by relapses. As\\nthe disease progressed, bowel and bladder involvement and other\\nfunctional systems tended to gain in relative importance.\\nAffected functional systems were not fundamentally different\\nbetween RRMS and SPMS patients, when adjusting for the level of\\npre-existing disability. There were no striking differences in the\\nfunctional systems involved in a relapse to explain why patients\\nwere judged to have fully or incompletely recovered from relapses\\n(Supplementary Fig. 2). The investigator-judged level of relapse re-\\ncovery was well in-line with the EDSS-based recovery from relapses\\n(Supplementary Fig. 3).\\nPre-existing disability (as measured by the EDSS total score,\\nprior to the relapse) and patient’s age at the time of the relapse\\nwere the most important and consistent risk factors for incomplete\\nrecovery from relapses in all datasets (Fig. 4A). The higher the level\\nof pre-existing disability and the older the age, the lower the\\nchances of a complete recovery. In addition, male sex was suggest-\\nive of a lower likelihood for a complete recovery from relapses. In\\nthe full and the phase 3 datasets, there was also a trend suggesting\\nbowel and bladder involvement (which tends to occur at later\\nstages in the disease) may be associated with risk of an incomplete\\nrecovery from relapses; however, the numerical differences were\\nsmall and not consistent across all datasets. Other functional sys-\\ntems were not consistently prognostic after accounting for EDSS\\nand age. Also, a diagnosis of RRMS or SPMS did not impact the re-\\ncovery from relapse when accounting for age and pre-existing level\\nof disability (Fig. 4A and B).\\nThe probability of a complete relapse recovery (as judged by the\\ninvestigator) was highest (≏ 75%) in the youngest, least disabled\\nRRMS patients and decreased gradually with age and higher levels\\nTable 2 The prognostic value of relapses for subsequent disability worsening\\nFull dataset (n = 27 328) Phase 3 trials ( n = 8346) Phase 3 placebo-controlled trials ( n = 4970)\\n6-month CDW HR 95% CI P-value HR 95% CI P-value HR 95% CI P-value\\nARR1 1.47 1.41, 1.55 <0.001 1.48 1.40, 1.57 <0.001 1.31 1.21, 1.41 <0.001\\nARR2 1.38 1.29, 1.47 <0.001 1.37 1.25, 1.49 <0.001 1.17 1.03, 1.33 <0.019\\nn refers to the analysis set totals.

For severely disabled patients above\\nthe age of 40 years, the probability of a full recovery from a relapse\\nwas not notably different between RRMS and SPMS patients and\\nwas approximately 50% or less (Fig. 4B). Similar ﬁndings were\\nseen in the phase 3 studies (Supplementary Fig. 4).\\nTime between milestone disability levels and the\\neffect of treatment\\nWe investigated the time to milestone disability levels and the pos-\\nsible impact of current DMTs on these transition times. A total of\\n193 513 EDSS transitions from one visit to the next fromn = 22 808\\npatients from the full analysis set informed the analysis. This in-\\ncluded transitions to higher (worsening) or lower (improvement)\\nEDSS values or no change (stable disease).\\nFor illustration purposes, the Markov-model-estimated transi-\\ntion matrix for a patient with multiple sclerosis at the age of 40\\nyears is presented inSupplementary Fig. 5. In our study, for each\\nvalue of age and whether the patient was on or off a DMT at the\\ntime of the transition, a different transition matrix was estimated.\\nFor patients with no or only minimal disability (EDSS≤2) the esti-\\nmated probability to remain at the same stage for a year was ap-\\nproximately 40%; for patients with moderate to severe disability\\nbut who were ambulatory (EDSS = 3 to 5), the probability to remain\\nat the same stage for a year was lower. Once patients needed a\\nwalking aid or were dependent on a wheelchair (EDSS = 6 to 7),\\nthe probability to remain at the same stage for a year was >60%.\\nThus,‘stay times’ at a speciﬁc EDSS levels were initially long\\nwhen patients were not (or only minimally) disabled; they were\\nrelatively short when patients were more impaired but able to\\nwalk, and they lengthened again when patients were dependent\\non a walking aid or a wheelchair.Supplementary Fig. 6describes\\nunequal ‘stay times’ at different EDSS scores based on the full\\ndataset.23\\nThe time to reach milestone disability levels and the impact of\\ntreatment, is summarized in Table 3. Placebo-treated patients\\nwere estimated to reach EDSS 4 on average within approximately\\n9.0 years, while patients who used DMTs took 12.5 years to reach\\nthe same level of disability; i.e. the time to reach EDSS 4 was signiﬁ-\\ncantly prolonged by treatment by approximately 3.5 years.\\nSimilarly, patients on placebo in the respective phase 3 trials\\nneeded a walking aid signiﬁcantly earlier (after 18.5 years) com-\\npared with treated patients (21.6 years); the time gained by treat-\\nment was estimated at 3.1 years. At all tested stages of the\\ndisease, there was a signiﬁcant time gain with treatment, but the\\ntime gain between EDSS 4 and 6 (1.4 years) was less than the time\\ngain between EDSS 1 and 4 (3.5 years).\\nThe time to milestone disability levels based on worsening at-\\ntributed to PIRA (with or without relapses) or RAW in RRMS patients\\nis reported inTable 3. The corresponding baseline characteristics\\nare presented inSupplementary Table 4. The subgroup of RRMS pa-\\ntients who had all-cause CDW events reached milestone EDSS le-\\nvels earlier (e.g. EDSS 1–4 in 2.60–3.97 years) than the overall\\ngroup of placebo-treated RRMS patients, which also included a pro-\\nportion of patients who did not worsen (i.e. 8.95 years for the same\\ntransition for the overall placebo group). RRMS patients who wor-\\nsened due to PIRA reached milestone EDSS levels only slightly fas-\\nter (CIs overlap) than those who worsened due to RAW events; the\\nfastest worsening was observed in RRMS patients who experienced\\nPIRA events in combination with superimposed relapses.\\nDiscussion\\nIn a large clinical trial dataset from the NO.MS database with >27 000\\npatients and≏ 200 000 EDSS transitions, we investigated the me-\\nchanisms by which patients with multiple sclerosis accumulated\\ndisability. RAW was the main driver of worsening only in paediat-\\nric multiple sclerosis, while in adult multiple sclerosis PIRA was\\nseen across all phenotypes, albeit at a lower frequency in RRMS\\nFigure 4 Continued\\nother covariates.

RAW and\\nPIRA contributed relevantly to the overall accumulation of dis-\\nability in adult RRMS while, in SPMS and PPMS, PIRA was the dom-\\ninant driver of disease worsening. Baseline features of adult\\npatients with RRMS who experienced either PIRA or RAW events\\nwere not substantially different, and were typical of RRMS, show-\\ning that progression plays a clinically relevant role also in RRMS.\\nPatients with RAW events had on average higher on-study MRI ac-\\ntivity compared with patients who experienced PIRA events, con-\\nsistent with the expected underlying pathology.\\nIn our analysis, we tested more stringent deﬁnitions of PIRA\\nthan those proposed by Kappos and colleagues1: To increase speci-\\nﬁcity, and to best answer our research question, we required dis-\\nability worsening and progression events to be reﬂected in the\\nEDSS score, while Kappos and colleagues1 used a composite of\\nthe EDSS score combined with hand-coordination (Nine-Hole Peg\\nTest) and walking ability (Timed 25-Foot Walk Test), with a majority\\nof progression events not being reﬂected in the EDSS. Furthermore,\\nwe required progression to be independent of all investigator-\\nreported relapse activity (instead of only EDSS-conﬁrmed or\\n‘protocol-deﬁned’ relapses), thereby classifying fewer events as\\nPIRA. Lastly, we required that PIRA events were not only 3- or\\n6-month conﬁrmed but also sustained in all longitudinal follow-up\\ndata, i.e. we deﬁned PIRA as an irreversible deterioration occurring\\nin the absence of any reported relapse activity. Tightening of the\\nPIRA deﬁnition in our study lowered the absolute numbers of\\nPIRA events but produced a result that remained qualitatively un-\\nchanged in comparison to theﬁndings by Kappos and colleagues1:\\nPIRA, as detected by regular EDSS assessments, occurs and contri-\\nbutes to disability worsening in patients with RRMS.\\nProgression is underestimated as a contributing mechanism to\\nthe all-cause accumulation of disability in RRMS. This may be partly\\nattributed to differences between clinical practice and clinical\\ntrials, such as the standardized visits and monitoring of\\nEDSS scores in trials that is more conducive to detecting gradual\\nworsening compared with clinical practice. In addition, in patients\\nwho experience a relapse, gradual worsening occurring prior to this\\nevent may be attributed incorrectly to the relapse, i.e. some pro-\\ngression may be masked by episodes of acute neurological symp-\\ntoms. It may also be the case that the loss of function over time is\\nso gradual in some patients as to be unnoticed by the patient or\\nphysician.9 However, in contrast to the results previously reported\\nfrom the EPIC study,9 most (≏ 90%) of the 24 469 patients diagnosed\\nwith RRMS in our dataset did not experience a 6-month CDW, per-\\nhaps attributable to the use of DMTs, and the proportion of patients\\nwith RRMS who experienced PIRA events and thus fulﬁll the deﬁn-\\nition of SPMS was small (3.4%).\\nOur analysis of the NO.MS database conﬁrmed evidence of pro-\\ngression in early RRMS, and that patients with progressive multiple\\nsclerosis (SPMS and PPMS) can have focal lesions and relapses. In a\\nprevious study, the diagnostic uncertainty of the transition from\\nRRMS to SPMS was estimated at 4.3 years.24 Our data suggest the ex-\\ntent and relative importance of focal inﬂammation and progression\\nvaries gradually with the patients’age and pre-existing disability le-\\nvel, often without a sudden transition point to progressive disease.\\nGradual clinical worsening may be more easily detectable when\\nacute attacks are less frequent, either when relapse activity declines\\ndue to older age,16 or when acute inﬂammation is suppressed by\\ntreatment and underlying progression is revealed. In the phase 3\\nstudies with ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing multiple scler-\\nosis, ocrelizumab signiﬁcantly reduced the frequency of relapses\\nand all-cause disability worsening events versus interferon\\nbeta-1a25; however, out of the remaining all-cause disability worsen-\\ning events, a higher proportion of PIRA events were seen in the ocre-\\nlizumab arm (≏ 90%) than in the interferon beta-1a arm (≏ 80%).1\\nSimilarly, in the NO.MS database, DMT treatment reduced the fre-\\nquency of relapses, all-cause disability worsening events, RAW and\\nPIRA compared to placebo in the phase 3 trials, but resulted in a high-\\ner proportion of remaining disability worsening events occurring in-\\ndependently of relapse activity. This was not only observed in adult\\nRRMS, but also in paediatric multiple sclerosis where progression is\\nconsidered least likely to occur.\\nThe occurrence of clinical progression in the form of PIRA in early\\nRRMS (despite effective anti-inﬂammatory treatment) suggests that a\\ngradual pathological process (e.g. central or diffuse inﬂammation)\\nand/or secondary degeneration (as a consequence of accumulating\\nsubclinical disease burden) plays a role in multiple sclerosis from\\nthe onset of the disease. Indeed, brain volume loss, instead of\\nage-expected brain volume growth, was observed in paediatric pa-\\ntients treated with interferon beta-1a orﬁngolimod in the\\nPARADIGMS study.26 Although ﬁngolimod signiﬁcantly reduced the\\nfrequency of relapses by 82% compared with interferon beta-1a27\\nand signiﬁcantly lessened the amount of brain volume loss, a net\\nloss of brain volume was observed in both active treatment arms.\\nBrain volume and neuronal loss seem to be common features in mul-\\ntiple sclerosis, even in the earliest stages of the disease.16,28,29\\nBased on data from the TRANSFORMS30 and FREEDOMS31 stud-\\nies (which are part of the NO.MS database), baseline T2 lesion vol-\\nume was identiﬁed as the most important baseline risk factor\\nassociated with brain atrophy32 and neuronal loss33,34 in RRMS.\\nSimilar ﬁndings were reported in patients with progressive disease\\n(PPMS) from the INFORMS trial.35 The prominent role of T2 lesion\\nvolume (which marks cumulative prior inﬂammation as a risk factor\\nfor further brain tissue and neuronal loss and clinical deterioration)\\nis supportive of the topographical model of multiple sclerosis. In\\nthis model, clinical progression recapitulates a patient’s prior re-\\nlapses and unmasks previously asymptomatic lesions.36 Early in\\nthe disease, the majority of lesions may go unnoticed by the pa-\\ntient,37 or patients may initially recover well from relapses.\\nHowever, cumulative subclinical damage, measurable in the form\\nof the total T2 lesion volume or the rate of brain atrophy, seems to\\nplay an important role in driving further brain tissue loss and the in-\\nsidious disability of multiple sclerosis.9,38,39 Searching our NO.MS\\ndatabase for the youngest patients with a diagnosis of SPMS\\nrevealed that they had a mean T2 lesion volume >20 cm3 indicating\\na history of substantial inﬂammation, and many had a paediatric\\nonset [observed in 67% (8/12) of patients diagnosed with SPMS at\\n<25 years of age, and 40% (18/45) of those with a SPMS diagnosis at\\n<30 years].16 This suggests that ongoing multiple sclerosis disease\\nactivity, either clinical or on MRI, is associated with irreversible\\ndamage to the CNS from disease onset, and that early prevention/\\ntreatment intervention could delay subsequent progression.\\nOur study conﬁrmed that relapses are a signiﬁcant and clinically\\nmeaningful contributor to all-cause disability worsening. This is in\\nline with observations that relapses frequently lead to residual def-\\nicits,10,40–42 and that persistent focal inﬂammatory activity early in\\nthe disease is predictive of severe EDSS worsening.43–46 The authors\\nof a natural history cohort of 1844 patients with multiple sclerosis\\nfrom a single center came to a different conclusion, stating that\\n3158 | BRAIN 2022: 145; 3147–3161 F.

Notably, the use of survival methods (time to\\nevent models) outside of a randomized controlled study, where\\nbaseline characteristics between the RRMS and PPMS cohorts in-\\ncluded in the analysis likely differed in many aspects (including pa-\\ntients’ages and baseline EDSS scores), thus limiting the validity of\\ncomparing EDSS transition times. In our study, we used\\nAndersen-Gill models because they are statistically more suitable\\nthan survival methods as they take into account that patients may\\nrelapse and worsen repeatedly. They also can address the question\\nof whether accumulation of disability is more likely following a\\ntime period (e.g. a year) with relapses than following a time\\nperiod without relapses, based on a time-varying covariate\\nanalysis within the overall cohort (i.e. they do not require a\\nseparation of patients into different cohorts, which can lead to\\nbias). We found that following a year with relapses (annualized\\nrelapse rate-1 year), the risk of an all-cause disability worsening sig-\\nniﬁcantly increased by approximately 30–50%, depending on the\\ndataset.\\nWe identiﬁed pre-existing disability and older age as the princi-\\npal risk factors to further deterioration, in agreement with Chitnis\\net al.13 This suggests that patients developing residual disability after\\na relapse are more likely to do so on subsequent relapses, perhaps\\ndue to patients lacking adequate repair capacity or neuronal plasti-\\ncity. Additional risk factors for an incomplete recovery from relapse,\\nthough of lower value, were male sex and bowel and bladder in-\\nvolvement. As a limitation, we could not study race or ethnicity as\\npotential risk factors, due to the anonymization of the data.18\\nWe analysed the time to reach milestone EDSS levels based on\\ncontinuous time Markov models. Overall, our estimation of the dis-\\nability trajectories from placebo-treated clinical trial patients close-\\nly resembled the long-term trajectories previously described in\\nnatural history cohorts, likely reﬂecting the disease as well as the\\nscale properties of the EDSS scores.4,21,23 Based on our NO.MS data-\\nbase, we estimated that placebo-treated patients with RRMS take\\napproximately 9.0 years from EDSS = 1 (minimal disability)\\nto reach an increased limitation in walking ability (EDSS = 4) and\\n18.5 years to requiring walking assistance (EDSS = 6). Within the\\nsubset of patients with RRMS who experienced a 6-month CDW,\\nwe further analysed the time to milestone EDSS scores by clinical\\nmechanism of worsening (the baseline characteristics of patients\\nwith RAW or PIRA events were roughly comparable only within\\nthe RRMS population). The fastest transition from EDSS 1–4 was es-\\ntimated in the subgroup of patients with RRMS who experienced a\\ncombination of relapses and PIRA events (approximately 2.6 years).\\nFinally, we analysed the impact of treatment in NO.MS, and found\\nthat DMTs can signiﬁcantly delay the time to milestone disability\\nby approximately 3.5 years between EDSS 1 and 4, and by approxi-\\nmately 1.4 years between EDSS 4 and 6, suggesting that the beneﬁt\\nof treatment is highest in the earliest stages of the disease.\\nIn conclusion, relapses are signiﬁcant drivers of the accumula-\\ntion of disability primarily, but not exclusively, early in multiple\\nsclerosis. Our study conﬁrms that PIRA has been underestimated\\nas a contributing factor in RRMS: PIRA plays a signiﬁcant role in dis-\\nease worsening in adult RRMS and gradually becomes the principle\\nway by which patients with multiple sclerosis acquire disability in\\nprogressive disease. PIRA occurs early in the disease, as shown in\\nour study in patients with successful suppression of inﬂammation\\nwith efﬁcacious DMTs, which supports the existence of an ongoing\\ntreatment-resistant pathology from the start. Our study demon-\\nstrated that time to disability milestones can be delayed by several\\nyears with treatment, with the highest potential to gain time in the\\nyoungest, least disabled patients with multiple sclerosis.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors acknowledge the physicians and patients who partici-\\npated in these studies for their valuable contribution towards the\\nadvancement of our knowledge in multiple sclerosis.

The underlying cause of MS\\nand mechanisms behind this increase remain opaque, although complex gene–\\nenvironment interactions almost certainly play a signiﬁcant role. The epidemi-\\nology of MS indicates that low serum levels of vitamin D, smoking, childhood\\nobesity and infection with the Epstein–Barr virus are likely to play a role in\\ndisease development.

MS is a\\ncomplex disease; many genes modestly increase disease\\nsusceptibility in addition to several well deﬁned envi-\\nronmental factors, in particular vitamin D or ultravio-\\nlet B light (UVB) exposure, Epstein –Barr virus (EBV)\\ninfection, obesity and smoking [3].\\nMultiple sclerosis has historically been classiﬁed as\\nan organ-speciﬁc T-cell mediated autoimmune disease.\\nHowever, the success of B-cell targeted therapies chal-\\nlenges the standard T-cell autoimmune dogma [4]. It\\nis traditionally viewed as a two-stage disease, with\\nearly inﬂammation responsible for relapsing–remitting\\ndisease and delayed neurodegeneration causing non-\\nrelapsing progression, i.e. secondary and primary\\nprogressive MS [5,6].\\nThe emergence of increasingly eﬀective biological\\ntherapies and an active approach to treating MS, in\\nparticular treating to a target of no evident disease\\nactivity (NEDA), are changing the long-term outcome\\nfor people with MS (pwMS). More aggressive immune\\nreconstitution therapies, that result in a proportion of\\npwMS entering long-term remission, oﬀer a small\\nnumber of pwMS a potential cure [7]. Recent positive\\ntrials of disease-modifying therapies in progressive MS\\noﬀer those with more advanced MS the hope of slow-\\ning their disease progression, with preservation of\\nresidual function [8]. The fact that treatments appear\\nto work at multiple stages in the disease course signiﬁ-\\ncantly challenges the traditional two-stage view of the\\nnatural history of MS [9].\\nEpidemiology and aetiology\\nIt is often stated that the cause of MS is unknown;\\nhowever, this is not quite correct. EBV, sunshine\\n(UVB), smoking and vitamin D, combined with an\\nindividual’s genetic background, play important roles\\nin the causal pathway that results in MS development\\n[10]. Migration studies consistently support MS being\\nsecondary to an environmental exposure [11]. Adult\\nCorrespondence: R.

Migration studies indicate that environment\\ntrumps genetics and argue strongly for prevention\\nstudies targeting known environmental risk factors.\\nBeing truly EBV negative protects from developing\\nMS [12,13]; symptomatic EBV infection (i.e. infectious\\nmononucleosis) doubles the chances of getting MS\\n[14]. Evidence regarding the mechanism via which\\nEBV increases MS risk is heterogeneous; molecular\\nmimicry is historically a popular theory [15]. More\\nrecently EBV-induced B-cell immortalization and/or\\ntransformation has been thought to play an important\\nrole in disease development [16].\\nMultiple sclerosis is increasingly a global disease [2].\\nMS prevalence increases with latitude; however, this\\ngradient is decreasing in Norway and the USA, the\\ntwo countries where it has been studied [17]. The lati-\\ntudinal gradient in MS prevalence is strongly corre-\\nlated with UVB exposure, which stimulates cutaneous\\nvitamin D (vD) production. Low vD levels, decreased\\nintake of vD, reduced outdoor activity and increased\\nMS susceptibility associated with genetic polymor-\\nphisms causing low vD levels have implicated vD in\\nthe causal pathway of MS [18].\\nMultiple sclerosis is more common in females, but\\nthis has not always been the case. In case series from\\nthe early 1900s the sex ratio was almost equal. Since\\nthen, the sex ratio has steadily been increasing and it\\nis now close to 3:1 (F:M) in most developed countries\\n[19]. Smoking, which increases MS risk by approxi-\\nmately 50%, can explain up to 40% of the increased\\nincidence of MS in women [20]. Prior to the Second\\nWorld War, few women smoked, but the number of\\nwomen smoking rapidly increased post-war, mirroring\\nthe increasing incidence of MS in women [20]. The\\nobservation that organic solvents [21] and smoked\\ntobacco [22], but not oral tobacco or snuﬀ [23], are\\nassociated with MS has led to the hypothesis that\\nthese agents cause post-translational modiﬁcations via\\nantigen presentation occurring in the lungs.\\nIt is likely that MS risk modiﬁcation occurs\\nthroughout life, starting in utero [10]. The month-of-\\nbirth eﬀect and increased concordance in dizygotic\\ntwins compared to siblings indicates that the intrauter-\\nine environment is important in establishing MS risk;\\nit is unclear whether this is due to common environ-\\nmental exposures, or epigenetic mechanisms, or both\\n[10]. There is a genetic inﬂuence on MS susceptibility;\\nabout one in eight patients have a family history of\\nMS [24]. Concordance in female monozygotic twins\\napproaches 30% in the UK and Canada, but is as low\\nas~8.5% in southern Europe [25].\\nThe main genetic risk associated with MS resides in\\nHLA-DRB1*15 and/or other loci in strong linkage\\ndisequilibrium with this allele [26]. Heterozygotes for\\nHLA-DRB1*15:01 have an odds ratio of MS >3 and\\nhomozygotes >6 [26], yet the mechanism remains\\nunknown. It is hypothesized that HLA-DRB1 *15:01’s\\nrole is via antigen presentation; however, this does\\nnot explain the protective eﬀects of class 1 alleles (e.g.\\nHLA-A*02:01) [27].\\nGenome-wide association studies have identiﬁed\\nmore than 150 single nucleotide polymorphisms associ-\\nated with MS susceptibility [28]. The odds ratio associ-\\nated with the majority of these is small, around 1.1–1.2.\\nMany of these single nucleotide polymorphisms lie\\nclose to genes associated with immune function, typi-\\ncally in regulatory rather than coding regions. Func-\\ntional variants identiﬁed include those within IL7R\\n[29], IL2RA [30], TNFR1 [31], BAFF [32] and CYP2R1\\n[33]. Mendelian randomization studies have provided\\nevidence for a role of vitamin D [33–35] and obesity\\n[36] as independent risk factors causing disease.\\nRecent work has uncovered genetic diﬀerences\\nbetween relapsing –remitting MS (RRMS) and primary\\nprogressive MS (PPMS) [37] not previously detected in\\ngenome-wide association studies, most probably due to\\nthe under-representation of PPMS in these cohorts.\\nGenetic variants associated with other progressive neu-\\nrological disorders are relatively over-represented in\\nprogressive MS [37]. Similar genetic risk exists when all\\nMS-associated alleles are taken into account, indicating\\nadditional risk for progressive disease superimposed on\\nunderlying genetic susceptibility. Evidence of diﬀeren-\\ntial gene transcription between RRMS and PPMS [38]\\nagain hints at individual diﬀerences on a background of\\nshared genetic risk.\\nPathology and immunology\\nIn Charcot’s original descriptions of the pathology\\nassociated withscl/C19erose en plaques, he described ‘scle-\\nrosed plaques’ aﬀecting the periventricular area, pons\\nand spinal cord [39]. The characteristic pathological\\nhallmark of MS is perivenular inﬂammatory lesions,\\nleading to demyelinating plaques [40]. The inﬂamma-\\ntory inﬁltrates contain T-lymphocytes, dominated by\\nMHC class I restricted CD8+ T-cells; B-cells and\\nplasma cells are also present, although in much lower\\nnumbers [41]. Oligodendrocyte damage and demyeli-\\nnation occur as a result of inﬂammation. Axons are\\nrelatively preserved in the early stages of the disease;\\nhowever, as disease progresses irreversible axonal\\ndamage develops [42].

The composition of the\\ninﬂammatory inﬁltrate in relapsing –remitting and\\nprogressive MS is similar, although the proportion of\\nB-cells and plasma cells is higher in progressive MS\\n[44]. Whether the cytokine proﬁle or activation stage\\nof T-cells and B-cells diﬀers between clinical disease\\ntypes remains unclear [41].\\nRemyelination is seen in all disease stages, most\\ncommonly in progressive disease [41]. Patients with\\nsecondary progressive MS have higher levels of\\ndemyelination and a reduction in axonal density in\\nthe normal appearing white matter in the cervical\\nspinal cord in PPMS [45]. There is no single charac-\\nteristic histological diﬀerence between MS subtypes,\\nbut instead a diﬀerence in the proportion of areas\\nshowing particular characteristics. Thus, whilst three\\nclinical forms of MS have been deﬁned, the pathologi-\\ncal changes form a continuum. This ﬁts with gradual\\nclinical disease evolution in patients, from RRMS to\\nsecondary progressive MS over a period of years.\\nClinical features\\nMultiple sclerosis is a journey from being at risk,\\nthrough the asymptomatic, prodromal and symp-\\ntomatic phases of the disease. MS is typically sus-\\npected when a person presents with a clinically\\nisolated syndrome (CIS). This can be mono- or poly-\\nsymptomatic depending on the location of the\\neloquent lesion(s). The most commonly seen presenta-\\ntions are optic neuritis, brainstem and spinal cord syn-\\ndromes; however, numerous other less common\\npresentations exist, including cortical presentations\\nsuch as dominant parietal lobe syndromes.\\nMultiple sclerosis relapses usually develop suba-\\ncutely over hours to days, reach a plateau lasting sev-\\neral weeks, and then gradually recover. Gross clinical\\nrecovery from relapses often appears complete in early\\nMS; however, most relapses leave behind some dam-\\nage. For example, following acute optic neuritis gross\\nvisual acuity may recover but colour vision, contrast\\nsensitivity and depth perception abnormalities persist.\\nAs neuronal reserve is lost, recovery from relapses\\nbecomes incomplete, and neurological deﬁcits accrue\\nleading to sustained disability.\\nFor every clinical attack, approximately 10 ‘asymp-\\ntomatic’ lesions are noted on magnetic resonance\\nimaging (MRI). Symptomatology results from a\\ncombination of location and size – a small lesion in\\nan eloquent area is likely to cause symptoms. Macro-\\nscopic, or MRI-visible, lesions are the tip of the ice-\\nberg; many more lesions can be seen at microscopic\\nlevel and even more in deep and cortical grey matter.\\nSecondary progressive MS typically develops 10 –\\n15 years after RRMS onset, with a gradual evolution\\nfrom discrete relapses to slowly progressive disease.\\nThere is not a distinct transition between disease\\ntypes; rather, relapses occur on a background of sub-\\ntle progression, prior to progression being dominant.\\nThe cognitive impairment and progressive MRI atro-\\nphy seen in early MS indicate that neurodegeneration\\nis present from clinical onset.\\nIn 5% –15% of cases there is a primary progressive\\nonset (PPMS), typically with gradual accrual of pro-\\ngressive disability involving one dominant neuronal\\nsystem. The commonest presentation is with a pro-\\ngressive spastic paraparesis, but sensory ataxia, cere-\\nbellar ataxia and cognitive and progressive visual\\nfailure are well-described PPMS variants.\\nThere has been a reduction in the proportion of\\npeople with PPMS [46]. This is probably related to\\nthe fact that there are no licensed treatments for\\nPPMS; patients may be labelled as having relapsing\\nMS in order to receive treatment, raising ethical ques-\\ntions about the division of MS into distinct subtypes.\\nThis artiﬁcial division of MS into diﬀerent diseases\\nwas driven by the pharmaceutical industry to get\\ninterferon beta licensed under the Orphan Drug Act\\nin the USA.\\nPaediatric MS is considerably rarer than adult onset\\ndisease, with a highest reported incidence of 2.9/\\n100 000 [47]. The diagnosis is based on repeated epi-\\nsodes of demyelination separated by time and space.\\nDiﬀerentiating paediatric MS from acute disseminated\\nencephalomyelitis can be challenging, as paediatric\\nMS may be multifocal at onset [47]. Relapse rates\\nmay be higher, but physical recovery tends to be more\\ncomplete. Few treatments are licensed for use in chil-\\ndren, and referral to a paediatric neurologist with\\nexpertise in demyelinating disorders is recommended\\nwhere the diagnosis is suspected.\\nGiven the above, MS can be thought of as a single\\ndisease existing within a spectrum extending from\\nrelapsing (‘inﬂammatory dominant’) to progressive\\n(‘neurodegeneration dominant’), in keeping with the\\n2013 revisions to the clinical course of MS [48]. At\\npresent, MS deﬁnitions place artiﬁcial distinctions\\nbetween patients with progressive and patients with\\nrelapsing disease. Instead, these subtypes should be\\nseen as points on a continuum of disease, which\\nshould be expanded to include prodromal (i.e. radio-\\nlogically isolated) disease.\\n© 2018 EAN\\nMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS 29\\n 14681331, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ene.13819 by Azienda Usl Bologna, Wiley Online Library on [07/08/2024].

Migration studies\\nindicate that the time from exposure to environmental\\nrisk factors and the onset of disease is 10 –20 years\\n[49]. Pathological studies indicate that the preclinical\\nphase of MS could be decades; a Danish series found\\nthat a quarter of cases with postmortem pathological\\nevidence of MS were never diagnosed with MS in life\\n[50].\\nMultiple sclerosis begins before the ﬁrst clinical\\nattack; most patients presenting with a CIS have\\nolder, inactive, lesions on their MRI. Radiologically\\nisolated syndrome (RIS), or asymptomatic MS, is\\ndetected on an MRI done for unrelated reasons, such\\nas headache, head injury or screening in the airline\\nindustry. Even in these earliest stages there is evidence\\nof end-organ damage. MRI in young people with CIS\\nshows brain volume loss compared to controls [51].\\nSchool performance in children who later develop MS\\nis poorer than their peers [52], and a quarter of\\npatients with RIS have signiﬁcant cognitive impair-\\nment with a proﬁle similar to patients with established\\nMS [53]. This appears to indicate that not only is\\ninﬂammation present prior to diagnosis, but there is\\naccompanying neurodegeneration from the start.\\nIt is predicted that MS has the potential to become\\na model neurodegenerative disease, setting the stage\\nfor pre-symptomatic diagnosis for other neurodegen-\\nerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer’s and Parkin-\\nson’s disease. The big question is whether society is\\nready for population screening and pre-symptomatic\\ndiagnosis. At some point in time it is going to be nec-\\nessary to accept that, to have a meaningful impact on\\nthe burden associated with neurodegenerative disease,\\nthese conditions are going to have to be diagnosed in\\nthe pre-symptomatic phase.\\nImportant differential diagnoses\\nTable 1 lists the most common MS diﬀerential diag-\\nnoses or mimics. Red ﬂags include a ﬁrst relapse at an\\nolder age, where vascular disease is more likely. Non-\\nspeciﬁc white matter lesions may be seen in patients\\nwith no objective persisting neurological disability and\\nhistory of migraine, although migraine is more com-\\nmon in the MS population [54]. In those from low\\nprevalence areas and/or ethnic minorities, diﬀerential\\ndiagnoses must be carefully considered, as neurosar-\\ncoidosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and\\ninfections such as tuberculosis are more likely, and\\nMS-speciﬁc disease-modifying therapy may cause a\\nworsening of these diseases.\\nAnother red ﬂag is comorbid systemic symptoms\\nand signs; this should alert clinicians to exclude multi-\\nsystem diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus,\\nSj€ogren’s, Behc/C223et’s, Susac’s and other vasculitides. MS\\ncan coexist with other autoimmune diseases, and so\\nthe presence of these does not necessarily exclude MS,\\nand the overall clinical picture must be carefully\\nconsidered.\\nA diagnostic lumbar puncture is advised in all\\npatients presenting with possible MS. Cerebral spinal\\nﬂuid (CSF) analysis is helpful in both identifying MS\\nmimics and either supporting or arguing against a\\ndiagnosis of MS. Central nervous system (CNS) syn-\\nthesis of oligoclonal immunoglobulin G bands or\\noligoclonal bands (OCBs) can now be used to estab-\\nlish dissemination in time; it is hoped that this will\\nlead to a renaissance in the use of CSF for diagnostic,\\nprognostic and treatment response purposes.\\nInvestigations\\nThe diagnosis of MS remains clinical. However, treat-\\nable mimics should be excluded using paraclinical\\ninvestigations where indicated. All patients with sus-\\npected MS should have a lumbar puncture to help sup-\\nport the clinical diagnosis of MS, exclude MS mimics\\nand to help establish a baseline prognostic proﬁle.\\nSerological investigations\\nA standard baseline proﬁle should include anti-nuclear\\nantibody, vitamin B12 and thyroid function. Syphilis\\nand human immunodeﬁciency virus 1 serology are rec-\\nommended. Depending on the clinical presentation\\nhuman T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 and 2 serology,\\nanti-aquaporin-4 and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte gly-\\ncoprotein antibody screening may be indicated.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging\\nAll patients should undergo MRI imaging of at least\\nthe brain and, if the presentation is spinal, imaging\\nshould include the spinal cord. Imaging has a dual\\npurpose– it can help to conﬁrm the diagnosis by\\ndemonstrating dissemination in both time and space,\\nbut it can also exclude MS mimics when interpreted\\nby an experienced neuroradiologist. Approximately\\n2% of non-MS-related abnormalities picked up on\\nMRI are incidental ﬁndings, e.g. pituitary adenomas,\\npineal cysts, vascular malformations, benign menin-\\ngiomas and prolapsed intervertebral discs.

Traditionally,\\nlesion accrual/count together with ‘active’ lesions\\n(gadolinium-enhancing) has been used to estimate dis-\\nease activity; however, correlation with long-term out-\\ncomes is imperfect. The importance of brain atrophy\\nseen on volumetric MRI is increasingly realized, as\\nwhen taken alongside lesion load there is good corre-\\nlation with long-term clinical outcomes [57].\\nHigh ﬁeld and double inversion MRI techniques\\nhave enabled the visualization of cortical MS lesions,\\nthe presence and number of which appear to correlate\\nwith clinical outcomes, most notably cognitive impair-\\nment [58]. Newer MRI techniques, including magneti-\\nzation transfer imaging, diﬀusion tensor imaging and\\nfunctional MRI are providing insights into disease\\nwith widespread abnormalities outside of focal lesion\\ndevelopment [59]; however, these techniques are not\\nyet in routine clinical practice.\\nTreatment and management of MS\\nThe treatment of MS can be divided into disease-mod-\\nifying therapies that tend to be MS-speciﬁc and symp-\\ntomatic therapies that are often used in diﬀerent\\ndisease areas to treat symptoms resulting from neuro-\\nlogical dysfunction.\\nDisease-modifying therapies\\nAs the number, and eﬃcacy, of disease-modifying\\ntherapies has increased, interest in early treatment of\\nMS in order to prevent long-term disability has\\ngrown. Historically, treatments have been immuno-\\nsuppressant (including ﬁngolimod, natalizumab, ocre-\\nlizumab) or immunomodulatory (such as interferon\\nbeta, glatiramer acetate, teriﬂunomide), meaning that\\nongoing treatment is required to maintain suppression\\nof inﬂammation (and disease activity). Immune recon-\\nstitution therapies (including alemtuzumab and\\ncladribine) can be given as short courses with the aim\\nof producing enduring immunological actions– this is\\nat present the closest to a potential cure for MS. This\\nraises the question as to whether early, or even pre-\\nsymptomatic, treatment can prevent clinically appar-\\nent disease (Figs 1 and 2, Table 3).\\nA recent concept in the treatment of MS is ‘no evi-\\ndence of disease activity’, or NEDA. This has developed\\nfrom the understanding that clinical relapses are only\\nthe tip of the iceberg in terms of MS disease activity.\\nOngoing inﬂammatory MRI activity occurs in excess of\\nclinical relapses; in addition, brain atrophy can progress\\nin the absence of overt inﬂammatory disease activity.\\nNEDA is deﬁned by clinical parameters (NEDA-1 and -\\n2– absence of relapses and clinical disease progression),\\ninﬂammatory MRI activity (NEDA-3) and MRI atro-\\nphy and biomarkers (NEDA-4 and -5 – CSF neuroﬁla-\\nment levels). In clinical practice, this has led to treatment\\nescalation earlier in disease, or early treatment with\\nhighly active therapies as ﬁrst line (Figs 1b and 3).\\nGiven that MS is most commonly diagnosed in\\nyoung women, pregnancy and family planning are real\\nconcerns for women with MS. Current evidence sug-\\ngests that pregnancy does not increase the risk of long-\\nterm disability in MS. However, it is also important\\nthat disease-modifying treatment is not unduly delayed,\\nespecially in those with active disease.

In general terms, these treatments\\nare not MS-speciﬁc. They include anticholinergics for\\nbladder dysfunction (which may contribute to cognitive\\nimpairment, necessitating an individualized approach)\\nand medication for neuropathic pain (typically tricyclic\\nantidepressants, or gabapentin and derivatives). Treating\\ncognitive impairment in MS is complex and centres\\naround the avoidance of possible contributors. Several\\nsymptomatic therapies have been licensed speciﬁcally for\\nMS. These include sativex for spasticity and fampridine\\nfor walking diﬃculties. An important aspect related to\\nsymptomatic therapies is sleep. The prevalence of diﬃ-\\nculties with sleeping increases as MS disease duration\\nincreases, and anxiety, depression and fatigue are more\\ncommon in those reporting poor sleep [61].

Recurrent infec-\\ntions such as urinary tract infections may not only\\nresult in transient worsening of MS-related symptoms\\nbut could upregulate mechanisms known to speed up\\nworsening disability.\\nAlthough the evidence supporting lifestyle and well-\\nness modiﬁcations in MS is weak, the value of these\\nfor general health is important.

At present, disease-\\nmodifying treatments are only available to people with\\nclinically relapsing forms of the disease and a minority\\nof those with progressive disease– those showing high\\nlevels of inﬂammatory disease on MRI.\\nBy better understanding MS as a disease contin-\\nuum, it can be seen that there is potential for treat-\\nment eﬀects in all MS subtypes. Clinical trial outcome\\nmeasures for relapsing disease are relatively easy to\\ndeﬁne; in those patients with progressive disease, clini-\\ncally measurable rate of change is slow and measuring\\nimpact on this already slow rate requires more sensi-\\ntive outcome measures than are in current use.\\nPatients with progressive disease have historically been\\ndenied treatment on the basis of negative clinical tri-\\nals; if the outcome measures used in these trials are\\ninsuﬃciently sensitive to measure treatment eﬀects\\nthen it is our responsibility as physicians to develop\\noutcome measures with better sensitivity, rather than\\nartiﬁcially separate disease subtypes.\\nThe fact that aetiological factors implicated in MS\\ndevelopment have the potential to be modiﬁed prior\\nto disease development opens the door to the poten-\\ntial for preventive trials.

In 80–90% of cases,\\nMS starts with a relapsing–remitting course (RR-MS).\\nOver time, the number of relapses decreases, but most\\npatients develop progressive neurological deficits that\\noccur independently of relapses (the so-called secondary\\nprogressive phase). In 10–20% of patients, MS begins\\nwith a primary progressive course (PP-MS) without\\nacute relapses. In general, the progression rate in RR-MS\\nis comparable to that of PP-MS as soon as the patients\\nenter the secondary progressive phase2. Imaging studies\\nhave revealed differences between RR-MS and PP-MS. In\\npatients that suffer from RR-MS, acute CNS lesions with\\nspontaneous resolution are frequently detected, even in\\nthe absence of clinical attacks3. These lesions are usually\\nlocated in areas of white matter, and are often character-\\nized by a disturbance of the blood–brain barrier, local\\noedema and demyelination — features that are compat-\\nible with an inflammatory process. By contrast, when\\nprogressing to the secondary phase and in patients with\\nPP-MS, such inflammatory activity is much less conspic-\\nuous3. Global brain atrophy, however, is more dominant\\nin the progressive stage and seems to correlate with dis-\\nability4,5. These findings indicate that early in the disease,\\nongoing inflammatory activity is present in most patients\\nand is responsible for the relapsing–remitting course,\\nwhereas a distinct process might be operative in the pro-\\ngressive phase of the disease, when inflammatory activity\\ndiminishes despite faster evolution of disability.\\nThe prevalence of MS varies significantly depending\\non the genetic background of the patient6. MS is highly\\nprevalent in Caucasians, but only rarely observed in\\nAsians or Africans. Even in areas with high MS preva-\\nlence, these ethnic groups are at much lower risk than\\nCaucasians. Moreover, the risk of developing the disease\\nis significantly higher in family members of patients with\\nMS7. By contrast, the prevalence in spouses and adopted\\nfamily members does not differ from that of the general\\npopulation. These findings argue for a strong genetic pre-\\ndisposition to MS, and have prompted a large number of\\nlinkage and association studies to identify disease loci and\\nNEW CONCEPTS IN THE\\nIMMUNOPATHOGENESIS OF\\nMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS\\nBernhard Hemmer*, Juan J. Archelos‡ and Hans-Peter Hartung§\\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a commonly occurring inflammatory and demyelinating neurological\\ndisease. It has been considered to be an autoimmune disorder mediated by CD4+ type 1 \\nT helper cells, but recent studies have challenged this idea by indicating a role for other immune\\ncells. So, T- and B-cell responses in the brain of patients with MS involve the clonal expansion of\\nlymphocytes and the antigen-driven maturation of the B-cell receptors, indicating that the immune\\nresponse in MS engages a broad range of immune cells that target a limited number of brain\\nantigens. At variance with the classical view, axons are not spared during the inflammatory\\nprocess. Indeed, axonal damage determines clinical outcome to a large extent. Studies of the\\nmechanisms of axonal damage and neurodegeneration in MS are in their infancy. Here, we\\nsummarize recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of MS, and conclude with\\nan outlook on how to capitalize on this knowledge to develop new therapeutic approaches.\\n*Department of Neurology,\\nPhilipps-Universität,\\nMarburg 35033, Germany.\\n‡Department of Neurology,\\nKarl-Franzens-Universität,\\nA-8036 Graz, Austria.\\n§ Department of Neurology,\\nHeinrich-Heine-Universität,\\nD-40225 Düsseldorf,\\nGermany.\\nCorrespondence to H.-P .H.\\ne-mail: \\nHans-Peter.Hartung@\\nuni-duesseldorf.de\\nDOI: 10.1038/nrn784'),\n",

For example, MS relapses are often associated\\nwith common viral infections 13, and migration from\\nhigh- to low-risk areas before adolescence reduces the risk\\nof developing MS14. In areas with homogeneous ethnic\\npopulations, MS prevalence varies, being higher in areas\\nwith moderate climate15. The impact of environmental\\nfactors is also supported by few reported ‘MS epidemics’ .\\nIn particular, the case of the Farøe Islands — where MS\\nwas unknown until 1940 and broke out shortly after\\nBritish soldiers landed on its shores — argues for the\\nrole of an environmental, possibly transmissible, agent\\nin disease pathogenesis16.\\nOverall, clinical studies indicate that MS is character-\\nized by at least two distinct phases, one that is dominated\\nby acute relapses and one by steady progression. Both\\ngenetic and environmental factors seem to contribute\\nsynergistically to the manifestation and progression of\\nthe disease.\\nFrom MS to EAE and back\\nThe classic EAE concept. The disease process in MS is\\nfocused on myelinated areas of the brain and spinal\\ncord17. Histopathological studies have shown that\\ndemyelination and inflammation involving B cells, T cells,\\nmacrophages and activated microglia are hallmarks of\\nacute MS lesions. Tissue damage, including loss of neu-\\nrons and oligodendrocytes, astrogliosis and remyelina-\\ntion, accompanies the inflammatory changes. The role of\\nthe immune system (BOX 1)in the pathogenesis of MS was\\nemphasized by early reports of acute demyelinating\\nepisodes in humans after accidental immunization with\\nmyelin components (for example, after vaccination\\nagainst rabies)18.\\nFollowing this lead, an animal model known as\\nexperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE),\\nwas established 70 years ago19 (FIG. 1). EAE is an inflamma-\\ntory disease of the CNS, with variable degrees of demyeli-\\nnation, that is induced by immunization of susceptible\\nanimals with myelin antigens and FREUND’S ADJUV ANT20.\\nAlthough EAE can be elicited in most rodents and in\\nsome monkeys, susceptibility, disease course and severity\\nare strain dependent. The role of an autoimmune\\nresponse in this model was formally proven by ADOPTIVE\\nTRANSFER experiments, which showed that immune cells\\nfrom a diseased animal can transmit disease to naive ani-\\nmals21. Myelin proteins were identified as the disease-\\ncausing antigens in EAE, and cell separation before\\nadoptive transfer indicated that mainly CD4+ T CELLS\\ntransmit the disease. With the introduction of T-cell\\ncloning technology, it became possible to show that \\nT cells that secreted T helper (TH) 1 CYTOKINES — such as\\ninterferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumour necrosis factor-β (TNF-β)\\nand interleukin 2 (IL-2), and the pro-inflammatory cyto-\\nkine TNF-α — were more likely to transfer the disease\\nalleles. The results of genomic screens in MS indicate that\\na considerable number of different genes, each having a\\nrelatively small contribution, are involved in the suscepti-\\nbility to MS8,9. The large variations in susceptibility loci\\nbetween the studies also indicate heterogeneity in disease\\nalleles, even in Caucasian populations. The role of genetic\\nfactors is even more complex, as they seem to be involved\\nnot only in disease manifestation, but also in the clinical\\ncourse of MS 10,11. Owing to the polygenic nature of\\ngenetic predisposition to MS, the identification of candi-\\ndate genes has been extremely difficult9. So far, only the\\nBox 1 | The acquired immune system\\nT cells\\nThe T-cell population is the central ‘arm’ of the acquired cellular immune response. Most\\nT cells carry T-cell receptors (TCRs) to recognize antigens that are bound to major\\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (human leukocyte antigens (HLA) in\\nhumans)122. The antigens are usually derived from complex proteins that are processed by\\nantigen-presenting cells (APCs). Through random recombination of the TCR genes, a\\nvery broad T-cell repertoire is generated, which is largely depleted from potentially\\nautoreactive T cells by a maturation process in the thymus. In lymph nodes, naive T cells\\nare approached by APCs, such as dendritic cells, which present antigens that are bound to\\nMHC molecules on their surface. After recognition of specific peptide–MHC complexes\\non the APC, the cell becomes activated, clonally expands and acquires effector functions\\n(such as cytotoxicity or the ability to secrete cytokines). The cells leave the lymph nodes,\\nmigrate through the body and accumulate at sites where they encounter their specific\\npeptide–MHC ligands. On reactivation, the T cells mediate effector functions that lead to\\nclearance of the antigenic source, and subsequently undergo apoptotic cell death. Only a\\nfew survive and remain in the immune system as a memory T-cell population.\\nThe population of T cells can be broken down into several subpopulations. T helper\\n(TH) cells, which are characterized by the expression of the CD4 receptor, usually\\nrecognize peptides from endocytotic sources in the context of MHC class II molecules.\\nCytotoxic T (TC) cells, which express the CD8 receptor, mainly respond to cytosolic\\nproteins in the context of HLA class I molecules. Additional T-cell subsets are\\ncharacterized by the secretion of specific immune mediators (cytokines and chemokines).\\nSo, TH1/ TC1 cells secrete interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumour necrosis\\nfactor-α (TNF-α). By contrast, TH2/ TC2 cells release IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Last,\\nTH0/TC0 cells secrete both TH1 and TH2 cytokines124.T H1 cells promote macrophage\\nactivation, facilitate the differentiation of cytotoxic cells and cause delayed hypersensitivity,\\nwhereas TH2 cells help B cells and stimulate allergic reactions. Importantly, T cells cannot\\nrecognize peptides in the absence of the appropriate MHC molecules, and the TCR does\\nnot change its molecular structure during repeated antigen exposure.\\nB cells\\nThe B-cell population is the central arm of the humoral immune response. The cells\\nrecognize antigens by means of the B-cell receptor (BCR)125. The BCR of each B cell is\\ngenerated through a random rearrangement process of the BCR genes, in a similar way to\\nTCR. B cells usually recognize soluble antigens and do not require antigen presentation by\\nother cells. Immature B cells, as for T cells, undergo a selection process in the bone marrow\\nto deplete autoreactive cells from the repertoire. After maturing, B cells express membrane-\\nbound immunoglobulin-µ (IgM) and migrate to the periphery. On encountering high-\\naffinity antigens, they migrate to the peripheral lymphoid tissue, proliferate, release soluble\\nIgM and differentiate into memory B cells or plasma cells126. During the differentiation\\nprocess, an isotype Ig switch from IgM to IgG (immunoglobulin-γ) occurs. Repeated\\nencounters with the same antigen by memory B cells induce a process of receptor\\nmaturation that is characterized by the introduction of random mutations in the BCR gene.\\nThis results in structural changes to the BCR, which usually lead to affinity maturation in\\nsome of the mutants. This process yields B cells that recognize the antigen more efficiently\\nthan the original B cell. The B cells with the receptors of highest affinity succeed in the\\nexpansion process and differentiate into plasma cells that secrete large quantities of\\nantibodies. BCRs can recognize intact soluble molecules and undergo genetic maturation.\\nThese features complement the more diverse, but less flexible, T-cell repertoire.'),\n",

Approaches that focus on silencing\\nthe immune response to myelin antigens, shifting\\nimmune responses from TH1 to TH2 or antagonizing\\nTNF-α, have all been shown to be highly efficient in most\\nEAE models36.\\nBroadening the EAE model.When similar approaches\\nentered clinical trials in humans, first observations in\\ngenetically modified animals began to question the\\nvalidity of the TH1 model37. Mice lacking IFN-γ develop\\nan even more severe disease38,39, and overexpression of\\nTH1 cytokines in the CNS ameliorates EAE40. By con-\\ntrast, disruption of the IL-4 gene does not alter the dis-\\nease course41. Although overexpression of TNF-α in the\\nCNS results in demyelination in most animal models37,\\nTNF-α knockout mice still develop EAE — in some\\ncases with a disease course that is even more severe than\\nthat of their wild-type littermates42–45. Because perma-\\nnent overexpression or disruption of immune genes can\\nsignificantly influence the development of the lymphoid\\nand nervous systems, the results from genetic animal\\nmodels of neuroinflammation have been interpreted\\nwith caution46.\\nDuring the mid-1990s, other studies of EAE\\nreported on the encephalitogenic potency of TH0 cells,\\nwhich secrete both TH1 and TH2 cytokines47.M o r e o v e r ,\\nit was even possible to induce EAE with myelin-specific\\nTH2 cells in a transgenic mouse model 48.H i s t o -\\npathological studies supported this observation by\\nshowing the presence of TH1 and TH2 cytokines in EAE\\nand MS lesions49,50. Recently, myelin-specific CD8+ T CELLS\\nwere found to induce progressive EAE51,52. Lesions in\\nthese models were located primarily in the brain — not\\nin the spinal cord as seen in most EAE models that are\\ninduced by CD4 + T cells — and featured only little\\ninflammation, but massive perivascular cell death and\\ndemyelination. Similarly, the role of antibodies in EAE is\\nwell established. B-cell-deficient mice develop EAE but\\nremission of disease is incomplete53. Antibodies cannot\\npassively transfer EAE to naive animals by themselves.\\nHowever, EAE severity in some models is significantly\\nenhanced by co-administration of myelin-specific anti-\\nbodies after induction of disease54. Finally, the role of\\nthe innate immune system has been clarified in EAE.\\nAlthough T cells are a cell population that transfers the\\ndisease, they are strictly dependent on INNATE IMMUNITYin\\nthe CNS. In particular, microglial cells provide the pro-\\ninflammatory milieu that is required for efficient \\nT-cell activation55.\\nThe CD4+ TH1 model was also questioned by EAE\\ntreatment studies. The potency of antigen-specific\\nintervention therapies was not strictly correlated with\\nthe extent of skewing immune responses from TH1 to\\nthan other myelin-specific T cells22. By contrast, T cells\\nthat secreted IL-4, IL-5, IL-10and IL-13seem to protect\\nanimals from the disease23.\\nThese findings established the widely accepted idea\\nthat EAE is a prototypic autoimmune disorder that is\\ncaused by a TH1 CELL response to myelin antigens.\\nBecause EAE shares some clinical and pathological fea-\\ntures with MS, the model was applied to the human\\ndisease. Further support for the idea that the disease\\nresults from a TH1-driven immune process was pro-\\nvided by a clinical trial showing that administration of\\nthe TH1 cytokine IFN-γ exacerbates MS24.\\nThe impact of EAE on MS.T o strengthen the idea that\\nMS is caused by a TH1 response to myelin, several labora-\\ntories have characterized immune responses to myelin\\nantigens in patients with MS. Although higher antibody\\ntitres to some myelin antigens are observed in the CNS\\nand serum of patients with MS, such autoantibodies are\\nalso found in healthy people25–27.

Indeed, the idea\\nthat MS is caused by an infectious agent has been contro-\\nversial for almost a century. However, the hypothesis is\\nstill attractive in view of other infectious diseases of the\\nCNS that cause inflammation and demyelination in\\nhumans, such as SUBACUTE SCLEROSING PANENCEPHALITIS or\\nHTLV-I-ASSOCIATED MYELOPATHY63. In both disorders, the cause\\nis a primary infection of the CNS with intact or mutant\\nvirus, whereas an inadequate immune response probably\\ncontributes to disease progression 63. The Theiler’s\\nmurine encephalomyelitis virus and the mouse hepatitis\\nvirus (MHV) induce demyelinating encephalitis in mice.\\nIn particular, the MHV model shares many features with\\nMS64. Mice naturally infected with MHV , which is a\\ncommon enteric pathogen, rarely develop spontaneous\\nacute encephalomyelitis. But direct inoculation of the\\nCNS with a low dose of virus usually leads to a chronic\\ndemyelinating encephalomyelitis. During the first phase\\nof disease, the virus replicates rapidly in the CNS and\\ninduces variable degrees of demyelination. After a few\\ndays, increasing mononuclear cell infiltrates that target\\nthe virus infection are observed. Predominantly CD8+\\nT cells, but also CD4+ T cells, are crucial for controlling\\nthe virus65, whereas B cells and antibodies seem to be less\\nimportant in the acute disease stage66. Although efficient\\nimmune responses are mounted in MHV-infected ani-\\nmals, CNS sterility is not achieved. Persistent latent virus\\ninfection is associated with continuing demyelination\\nfoci, although the virus cannot be recovered from the\\ninfected brains. In this phase, the HUMORAL RESPONSE is\\nessential for controlling virus reactivation67.H o w e v e r ,\\nT- and B-cell responses might contribute to the disease\\nmechanism that is involved in chronic tissue destruc-\\ntion68,69. The extent of disease and the outcome depend\\nlargely on the MHV strain and on the genetic back-\\nground of the mouse. In contrast to EAE, the immune\\nresponse in MHV infection is secondary to an immune\\nresponse that specifically targets viral antigens in the\\nCNS (FIG. 2).\\nThe quest for a pathogen that causes MS has been\\ncontinuing for almost a century. Neither the search for\\ninfectious particles in lesions nor the transmission of\\nbrain tissue to laboratory animals has so far identified a\\npathogen that is relevant to MS. Similar to autoantibody\\nstudies, many researchers have reported elevated antibody\\ntitres to a broad range of pathogens in patients with MS,\\nalthough these studies are not always confirmed. This\\nalso applies to recently proposed pathogens, such as\\nChlamydia pneumoniae, human herpesvirus type 6 and\\nEPSTEIN–BARR VIRUS70–74. The inconsistencies between studies\\nmight be a result not only of different experimental set-\\nups, but also of possible heterogeneity in exogenous fac-\\ntors that are involved in the predisposition to MS.\\nHowever, clear evidence that any pathogen has a role in\\nthe pathogenesis of MS is lacking so far.\\nNeurodegenerative disorders, traumatic CNS tissue\\ndamage and stroke — as well as infectious diseases —\\ncause inflammation of the CNS 75,76.

Likewise, therapeutic approaches to EAE in mon-\\nkeys induced a T H2 shift but resulted in severe\\nrelapses56. However, the most striking arguments for the\\nlimitation of the CD4+ TH1 model came from clinical\\ntrials in humans.

Therefore, recent immunological research has\\nfocused on the inflammatory response that is\\ndetectable in the CNS of patients with MS to clarify the\\nnature of the local immune response and the possible\\ntargets. Such approaches are reasonable because the\\nimmune cells that are enriched in the CNS of patients\\nwith MS probably have a causative or protective role in\\ndisease pathogenesis.\\nRethinking T- and B-cell responses in the CNS.It has been\\nknown for a long time that high concentrations of anti-\\nbodies are found in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid\\n(CSF) of patients with MS82. These high concentrations\\nare caused by a local OLIGOCLONAL immunoglobulin-γ\\n(IgG) response that mainly involves the IgG1 and IgG3\\nisotypes35,83,84. Indeed, the occurrence of an oligoclonal\\nINTRATHECALantibody response is still an important diag-\\nnostic marker for chronic CNS inflammation in MS.\\nInterestingly, the antibody response seems to be stable\\nover long periods and to involve a limited number of\\nclonotypes85. These findings were recently complemented\\nby investigations of antibody-secreting B cells in the CNS\\nand CSF of patients with MS 86–88. These studies uni-\\nformly showed preferential use of specific HEA VY-CHAIN\\ngenes or CLONAL EXPANSIONof B cells that were, largely, not\\nobserved in the peripheral blood of the patients 87,89.\\nExpanded B cells in CNS lesions have extensive replace-\\nment mutations that are clustered in the hypervariable\\nregion of the B-cell receptor genes (BOX 1). Accumulation\\nof B-cell clonotypes and antigen-receptor maturation is\\nseen only after repeated exposure of memory B cells to\\nthe same antigen, which strongly argues for an antigen-\\ndriven response. Such an immune response, involving\\noligoclonal IgG synthesis and clonal B-cell responses, is\\nnot unique to MS, but can be detected in a variety of\\nacute and chronic infectious CNS disorders. In acute dis-\\norders, the intrathecal immune response vanishes after\\nresolution of the infection, whereas in chronic infections,\\ncontinuous intrathecal antibody production is observed.\\nIn chronic CNS infections, the intrathecal IgG synthesis is\\nspecific for the infectious agent, such as defective measles\\nvirus in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis90.\\nSimilar studies were carried out to dissect the local \\nT-cell responses in the CNS of patients with MS. Early\\nstudies indicated overexpression of particular T-cell\\nreceptor (TCR) genes in MS brain lesions91. By analysing\\nsingle cells from lesions or CSF of patients with MS, two\\ngroups92,93 recently reported extensive clonal expansion of\\nT cells. In contrast to the commonly held view, clonal\\nexpansion was seen predominately in CD8+ and, to a\\nmuch lesser extent, in CD4+ T-cell populations92,93. In the\\nlesions of one patient, up to 30% of all T cells were\\nderived from a single CD8+ T cell, as shown by the analy-\\nsis of the molecular structure of their rearranged TCR92.\\nT cells expanded from lesions or CSF were not found at\\nhigh frequency in peripheral blood, indicating that a\\nfindings indicate that brain damage and release of\\nantigens to the periphery might prime an immune\\nresponse that seems to target the antigen source in the\\nbrain (FIG. 2). The immune system in these disorders\\nmight contribute to the disease process 76.P e r i p h e r a l\\nleukocyte depletion or inhibition of leukocyte migra-\\ntion reduces tissue damage in stroke. As acute CNS tis-\\nsue damage does not usually result in sustained CNS\\ninflammation, the possible autoimmune response is\\napparently well controlled and terminated after the\\ninitial event77. Some of the features of MS, such as the\\nearly loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes, are com-\\npatible with a primarily neurodegenerative cause of\\nthe disease. But an additional regulatory defect in the\\nimmune system must be present to explain the promi-\\nnent and sustained immune response that occurs in\\nthe CNS of patients with MS. A possible explanation\\nwould be a change in the inflammatory milieu that is\\nintroduced by alteration of the local innate immune\\nresponse78. Alternatively, insufficient control of the cel-\\nlular immune response in the CNS, accomplished by\\nredistribution of immune cells to the lymphoid system\\nor by local apoptotic cell death of immune cells, might\\nbe responsible79–81.\\nBox 2 | Immune defence in the central nervous system\\nThe brain has long been considered to be an immunologically privileged site. This idea is\\nbased on the observation that tissue transplants in the central nervous system (CNS) are\\nnot commonly rejected by the immune system. An anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic\\nenvironment in the brain, and the limited access of brain-derived antigens to the\\nlymphoid organs, were used to explain the lack of an effective immune response to\\nantigens in the brain. However, recent studies in infectious and autoimmune models have\\nchallenged this view. Systemic inflammation and tissue damage lead to activation of\\nmicroglia, which are the main ‘arm’ of the innate immune system in the CNS. Activation\\nof microglia results in release of inflammatory mediators and upregulation of immune\\nreceptors (for example, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules) on other\\nCNS cells, preparing ground for the acquired immune response in the CNS78,127.P r o t e i n s\\nreleased by tissue damage are quickly drained into local lymph nodes128. In the presence of\\nantigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, efficient B- and T-cell responses are\\ninitiated. After priming, these cells cross the blood–brain barrier, migrate to the site of\\nantigen exposure and develop effector functions129. Homing to the CNS, adhesion to the\\nendothelial lining and penetration of the blood–brain barrier encompass a highly\\ncoordinated sequential interaction of adhesion molecules that are reciprocally expressed\\non invading leukocytes and endothelium, the discharge of matrix metalloproteinases by T\\ncells and the T-cell perception of chemokines in the nearby CNS parenchyma130–132.\\nLikewise, B cells differentiate on re-encountering their antigen in plasma cells and release\\nlarge amounts of antibodies in the CNS. Similarly, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells become\\nactivated on encountering their antigen on appropriate MHC molecules, and release\\ncytokines or directly target the presenting cell. Although CD8+ T cells can recognize\\nantigen that is presented by neurons and glial cells, CD4+ T cells are dependent on\\nactivated microglial cells or infiltrating macrophages. These cells phagocytose cell debris,\\nefficiently capture antibody–antigen complexes by their Fc receptors, and present those\\nantigens on MHC class II molecules to CD4+ T cells. On activation, they secrete mediators\\nof inflammation such as tumour necrosis factor-α. Both the innate and acquired immune\\nsystem synergistically target the antigenic source and remove it from the CNS tissue. This\\nview is consistent with clinical observations that infections of the CNS induce vigorous\\nimmune responses, clearing pathogens from the site. Priming of T cells in the peripheral\\nlymphoid tissue is also essential for disease induction in active immunization and\\nadoptive-transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models133.

Different acute demyelinating lesions of any given\\npatient showed a similar composition, indicating that\\nlesion heterogeneity does not reflect different stages, but\\nrather distinct pathogenetic mechanisms. This hetero-\\ngeneity is at least partly reflected by the cellular composi-\\ntion of the CSF of patients with MS96. Histopathological\\nstudies have also addressed the process of de- and\\nremyelination in MS lesions. In acute lesions, inflamma-\\ntory changes are associated with demyelination and oligo-\\ndendrocyte loss. Although most of the damage is a direct\\nresult of the coordinated immune attack that is mediated\\nthrough specific cellular and humoral mechanisms, non-\\nspecific immune mediators, neurotransmitters and toxic\\nsubstances (such as nitric oxide) might significantly facili-\\ntate this process97 (FIG. 4). During the resolution of lesions,\\noligodendrocyte progenitor cells enter the area of\\ndemyelination, expand and develop into myelinating\\noligodendrocytes98,99. These cells myelinate axons and\\nspecific migration of these cells might have occurred into\\nthe CNS compartment. Serial studies showed the persis-\\ntence of CD8 + T cells in the CSF over a period of\\nmonths. The clonal accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the\\nCNS, together with the findings in B cells, strongly argue\\nfor an antigen-specific and highly focused immune\\nresponse in the CNS of patients with MS (FIG. 3).\\nLearning from lesion pathology.Important new implica-\\ntions for understanding MS have come from histopatho-\\nlogical studies.

In contrast to the high degree of phenotypic com-\\nplexity, the nature of the acquired immune response in\\nthe CNS of patients with MS seems to be less complex\\n(FIG. 3).

Binding of antibodies is solely dependent on the\\nantigenic protein itself, so all cells that express the specific\\nproteins are targets. Findings in EAE and infectious dis-\\nease models indicate that antibodies are most important\\nin the chronic phase of disease. This could also apply to\\nMS, although direct evidence is lacking. Several studies\\nhave investigated the focus of the local humoral\\nimmune response in MS. Using EXPRESSIONor PHAGE DISPLAY\\nLIBRARIES, antigen mimics were identified, although their\\npathogenic role in MS has not yet been established35,109,110.\\nThe role of CD4+ T cells — although suggested as key\\nplayers by studies of EAE — is much less clear. The lack of\\nsubstantial clonal expansion does not necessarily mean\\nthat these cells are not involved in the pathogenesis of MS.\\nIt is well established that the capacity of CD8+ T cells to\\nexpand clonally is much higher than for their CD4 +\\ncounterpart111. CD4+ T-cell responses in the lesions could\\nstill target specific antigens, but in a much broader man-\\nner, therefore escaping clonotype analysis. Alternatively,\\nthe cells could be nonspecifically recruited to sites of\\ninflammation, or even be involved in regulation or\\npriming of CD8+ T cells and B cells.\\nFinally, recent work indicates that immune cells might\\ncontribute to myelin regeneration and, possibly, neuro-\\nprotection in CNS lesions112. There is good evidence for\\nan involvement of growth factors, such as platelet-derived\\ngrowth factor, insulin-like growth factor, brain-derived\\nneurotrophic factorand neurotrophin 3, in myelin regen-\\neration. Immune cells release certain neurotrophins, lead-\\ning to a local accumulation in the CNS tissue.

However, additional studies are neces-\\nsary to establish the contribution of immune cells to CNS\\ntissue repair in human diseases.\\nBeyond immune pathogenesis.Although the coordinated\\nimmune attack in the CNS is clearly the most important\\nfactor in the early relapsing–remitting phase of MS, other\\nnon-immune-mediated mechanisms could dominate\\nthe chronic progressive phase. This assumption is sup-\\nported by the histopathological findings and by the fail-\\nure of most immunosuppressive and immunomodula-\\ntory treatments in patients in which the disease has\\nentered the progressive phase. The prominent loss of\\naxons and impaired myelin repair that are seen in this\\nphase resembles what is observed in some neurodegen-\\nerative disorders. Although little is known about this pro-\\ngressive phase, it is likely that general disease mechanisms\\nobserved in neurodegeneration are applicable.\\npro-inflammatory milieu.

Once the combined\\nattack of the acquired and innate immune responses has\\ncleared the target antigen from the site of the lesion, the\\ncells will either undergo activation-induced cell death or\\nredistribute to other tissues. In parallel, repair mecha-\\nnisms are initiated that result in remyelination. This cas-\\ncade of events is initiated during the course of MS at\\ndifferent locations in the CNS. As the oligoclonal IgG\\nbanding patterns persist in the CSF of patients with MS\\nand show little clonotypic variation over time, it is tempt-\\ning to speculate that at least the focus of the humoral\\nresponse does not change during the course of disease.\\nThe players and their targets.What are the targets of the\\nfocused immune response in patients with MS? As\\ninflammation is not observed in other tissues, CNS anti-\\ngens or antigens from CNS-resident infectious agents are\\ngood candidates. The dominance and persistence of an\\nintrathecal IgG1 and IgG3 antibody response, together\\nwith the locally expanded T cells, are consistent with an\\nongoing immune response against protein antigens.\\nHowever, the expression pattern of MHC molecules in\\nthe CNS tissue has hampered our development of models\\nof lesion pathogenesis. MHC class II molecules are\\nexpressed only on activated microglia and infiltrating\\nimmune cells (for example, macrophages and B cells). By\\ncontrast, all CNS cells can express MHC class I molecules,\\nwhich are recognized by CD8+ T cells105. In vitrostudies\\nhave shown that both oligodendrocytes and neurons can\\nefficiently present antigens to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, lead-\\ning to activation of T cells and damage to the presenting\\ncell106,107.

This might deter-\\nmine whether an immune response will rapidly clear a\\nspecific pathogen or how persistent infections are con-\\ntrolled. Similarly, the genetic mix-up could determine\\nhow readily autoimmune responses can be initiated and\\nwhich are the main targets. In addition, the genetic back-\\nground might govern the vulnerability of the different\\nCNS cells to immune mediators and the efficacy of\\nneuroprotective and neuroregenerative mechanisms. The\\ncomplexity that is introduced by the influence of genetic\\nbackground on the immune system and the CNS, in\\ncombination with possible exogenous factors, might\\nexplain the problems in identifying the molecular mecha-\\nnisms in MS, and the extent of heterogeneity in clinical\\nphenotype, progression and histopathological changes.\\nNew approaches and outlook on treatments\\nSome of the key players in the acquired immune system\\nthat are present in the lesions of patients with MS have\\nnow been defined. The findings support the view that\\nclonally expanded B and T cells recognize the relevant\\ntarget antigens independently of whether this is a primary\\nor secondary response. Over the next few years, it will be\\nimportant to use this immune response to hunt for target\\nantigens in MS. Although antibodies are much easier to\\nhandle than T cells, the amount of IgG that is available\\nfrom the CSF or brain of patients with MS is limited.\\nScientists have therefore begun to establish expression\\nsystems that allow the production of large quantities of\\nclonotypic antibodies from MS brain lesions114,115. These\\nsystems can be used to screen libraries from CNS tissue,\\ntissue sections or cultured CNS cells114. Furthermore, it\\nGLATIRAMER ACETATE\\nA synthetic protein that\\nsimulates myelin basic protein, a\\ncomponent of myelin. Through\\na mechanism that is not\\ncompletely understood, this\\ndrug seems to block T cells by\\nacting as a myelin decoy.

Family members have a higher risk of developing\\nthe disease compared with spouses or adoptees of patients with MS. The risk is highest for\\ntwins and siblings, and slightly lower for children and half-siblings135. The risk distribution\\nin families indicates a polygenic mode of inheritance. This view is also supported by the\\nresults of several genome screens in MS. Overall, more than 50 genomic regions showed\\nlinkage with MS, although only low or moderate LOD SCORESwere reached9. Comparison of\\ndifferent studies was rather disappointing, yielding overlap between at least two studies in\\nonly seven genomic areas. A recent meta-analysis136 of three large genome screens did not\\nidentify a single locus with a LOD score exceeding 3. Among the candidates for future\\ninvestigations are genes on chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 6, 17, 19 and X.\\nCandidate-gene approaches have also provided few conclusive results. These efforts have\\nfocused mainly on immunologically relevant genes. So far, only the human leukocyte\\nantigen (HLA)-DR15/DR6allele has been associated with the development of MS, and only\\nin Caucasians12. In addition, it is still unknown whether these alleles themselves — or other\\ngenes in LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM— are responsible for the higher susceptibility of carriers.\\nOverall, the studies agree with a polygenic and highly heterogeneous inheritance\\npattern of MS. Future studies will need large sample sizes and rigorous stratification of\\npatient and control groups. Furthermore, similar to other neurological diseases,\\ninvestigations in large MS pedigrees might be helpful to identify susceptibility genes. In\\naddition, the search for disease genes should focus not only on immune genes, but also on\\nthose involved in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. These genes might be\\nimportant not only for MS manifestation, but also in the progression of the disease.'),\n",

AI has two main approaches: machine learning \\n(ML) and deep learning (DL). ML is used to analyze \\ndata, then learn from data and make decisions, \\nwhereas DL learns and makes decisions with the help \\nof layers of artificial neural networks.6\\nDL is a subclass of ML techniques. DL is normally \\nused for large-scale datasets. For smaller datasets, \\nML techniques are preferred. Also, ML uses hand-\\ncrafted features (derived using numerous algorithms \\nfrom the information existing in the image itself) to \\nlearn and make decisions, whereas DL techniques \\ncan learn features independently and decide on fine-\\ntuning according to the input data.7 In this article, dif-\\nferent ML and DL algorithms are discussed in relation \\nto segmentation and prognosis of MS, but our focus \\nwill be considering DL methods in particular, as they \\nare diagnostically more efficient. ML/DL can be \\nsupervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised. A \\ngeneral diagram of how AI is applied to MS is shown \\nin Figure 1.\\nLiterature review\\nWhereas ML has had a long association with the pro-\\ncessing of medical images, DL only started gaining \\ntraction in this field in 2018, as evidenced by the rapid \\nincrease in related publications over that year. Figure 2 \\nshows the increase in the number of related publica-\\ntions between 2011 and 2020, while information about \\npublications relating to the segmentation and progno-\\nsis of MS from the last 10 years has been combined in \\nTables 3–5, respectively.\\nSearch strategy\\nTo find literature pertaining to recent developments in \\nMS detection and prediction, the digital libraries \\nScienceDirect, MEDLINE, Association for Computing \\nMachinery (ACM), Elsevier and SpringerLink for \\npublications from 2011 onwards were searched using \\nthe keywords ‘Multiple Sclerosis’, ‘artificial intelli-\\ngence’, ‘Machine learning’ and ‘deep learning’. \\nResults were then cross-checked using queries through \\nScopus, Web of Science and PubMed. The search \\nreturned 126 papers, with 72 papers focusing on ML/\\nDL in relation to MS, removing non-English articles, \\npreprints and articles not specifically related to seg-\\nmentation or prognosis of MS.\\nMRI protocols helping AI\\nTo monitor disease activity, accurate measurement of \\nnumber and volume of lesions is required. MRI is the \\nonly technique that allows non-invasive quantifica-\\ntion and characterization of MS lesions in the brain \\nand spinal cord. Longitudinal MRIs are important not \\nonly in tracking disease progression and evaluating \\nthe effectiveness of new drugs during clinical trials \\nbut also in clinical practice. A number of MRI proto-\\ncols have been developed to highlight the range of tis-\\nsue characteristics.8 For example, to achieve the best \\ngeneral visualization of MS lesions, T1-weighted \\n(T1-w), T2-weighted (T2-w) and T2-weighted fluid-\\nattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images are \\nnormally used, whereas contrast (gadolinium – Gd) \\nis used to determine acute activity.

These \\nare discussed in sections ‘Adoption of state-of-the-art \\nAI techniques by MS researchers’ and ‘Conclusion’.\\nRecent progress in AI for MS\\nA variety of methods have been developed for the \\ndetection/segmentation of MS lesions and for the \\nprognosis of disability in MS patients. First, each of \\nthese methods requires data collection, followed by \\npre-processing and then the application of ML/DL \\ntechniques.12\\nData collection\\nThe collection of data for AI research can be problem-\\natic for several reasons. First, MRI scans are expen-\\nsive, which limits the amount of data that can be \\ncollected by scans done purely for research purposes. \\nSecond, when using data from clinical scans, problems \\nwith non-uniformity due to differences in the types of \\nscanners, sequences used, slice thicknesses and time \\nintervals are a challenge for DL and ML techniques. \\nOne reason is that the unstructured data are more in \\nraw format than the structured data. Due to the com-\\nplexity of data, higher processing capacity is needed, \\nwhich is limiting the possibility of real-time analysis. \\nIn addition to this, there are ethical and privacy issues \\nassociated with the sharing of medical data.\\nTo overcome these issues, online datasets are made \\navailable for ML/DL researchers to apply their algo-\\nrithms. Perhaps, the most well-known of these are \\nthose associated with the International Symposium on \\nBiomedical Imaging (ISBI)13 and the Medical Image \\nComputing and Computer-Assisted Intervention \\n(MICCAI),14 both of which are available publicly for \\nqualitative as well as quantitative analysis of algo-\\nrithms.

Manually seg-\\nmented masks are provided as benchmarks for com-\\nparison. Both platforms are continually running \\nchallenges to foster improvement of algorithms.\\nPre-processing\\nThis process is required to clean the raw dataset \\nbefore being able to be used for analysis. Before ML/\\nDL techniques can be applied to an image, it is neces-\\nsary to first clean and standardize the data by pre-pro-\\ncessing it, so that the algorithm can be allowed to run \\noptimally. The most frequently used among these are \\nimage denoising, skull stripping, intensity normaliza-\\ntion and image registration, which were also used in \\nthe available datasets above.\\nML/DL techniques\\nAfter the data are pre-processed, different ML/DL can \\nbe applied. ML techniques, such as SVM, are gener-\\nally used for the classification of MS disease, whereas \\nDL techniques, such as CNNs (further consisting of \\n2D-CNNs and 3D-CNNs), recurrent neural networks \\n(RNNs), deep reinforcement learning (DRLs) and \\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs), are applied \\nfor the segmentation and prognosis of MS disease.\\nML/DL algorithms fall into one of the two basic cate-\\ngories: supervised or unsupervised.15 Supervised learn-\\ning needs labelled dataset to evaluate the accuracy of \\ntraining data, whereas unsupervised learning can be \\ntrained on unlabelled data and it extracts patterns and \\nfeatures on its own. To date, detection/segmentation \\nand prediction have been performed mostly by super-\\nvised learning techniques. According to Adhikary \\net al.,16 supervised learning is more commonly being \\nused because it does not require handcrafted features \\nfor training purposes. A review of studies done over the \\nlast 10 years has revealed 2D-CNN to be the most com-\\nmonly used technique for the detection/segmentation \\nor prognosis of MS (see Figure 7).\\nDetection/segmentation of MS lesions.

Their dataset consisted of images from 25 \\nMS patients from two hospitals.

Then \\nthey applied FAST-trimmed likelihood estimator to \\nmake decisions of rejection of voxels without lesions \\nusing T1-w, T2-w and FLAIR images. This resulted in \\nsegmentation of white mater, grey matter, CSF and \\nfinally, segmentation of MS lesions. They reported a \\nFigure 7.

Several algorithms37–41 have been \\ndeveloped for this specific purpose. They range from \\nsimple linear discriminant classifiers to the state-of-\\nthe-art CNNs. Ion et al.37 created an algorithm that \\nhelped to classify MS courses using a Gaussian kernel \\nwith the help of an SVM for the magnetic resonance \\nspectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and segmentation fea-\\ntures of brain tissues and were able to achieve up to \\n95% efficiency. MRSI is an important technique that \\ncombines spectroscopic and imaging techniques. It \\ncan help with the assessment of neurochemical \\nchanges in the brain and can therefore improve our \\nunderstanding of the pathological mechanism of MS. \\nZhao et al.38 proposed an algorithm for the prediction \\nof disease course in MS. They used SVM, specifically, \\na traditional ML technique for prediction. They also \\nimplemented logistic regression (LG) with linear and \\nnon-linear filters. This algorithm was tested on one of \\nthe larger clinical datasets, the Comprehensive Longi-\\ntudinal MS trial at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital \\n(CLIMB) study, consisting of 1693 patients. They \\nachieved 71% of sensitivity and 68% of specificity. \\nSeveral prognosis algorithms are mentioned in Table 5.\\nAdoption of the state-of-the-art AI techniques \\nby MS researchers\\nAI techniques in the field to date\\nThis section focuses on DL state-of-the-art techniques \\nwhich are being used for different purposes, such as \\nsegmentation/detection and prognosis of MS disease. \\nThe CNNs most commonly used in MS are AlexNet,36 \\nVGG,37 ResNet, 38 GoogLeNet 39 and CifarNet. 40 \\nThese DL techniques are used for either detection/\\nsegmentation or for the prognosis of disease.

ResNet – the \\nresidual network – is much deeper again than VGG. \\nCifarNet performs similar tasks to AlexNet but is \\narchitecturally different and has a much better accu-\\nracy than AlexNet. GoogLeNet, the winner of the \\nILSVRC 2014 competition, has an error rate of \\n6.67%, which is considered to be comparable to \\nhuman accuracy. Each of these networks is helping in \\nthe detection of diseases, such as MS.\\nAs already mentioned, challenge websites, such as \\nISBI and MICCAI, are also playing an important role \\nin the improvement of disease diagnostics. One of the \\nalgorithms in this challenge was developed by Brosch \\net al. using DL in the segmentation of MS lesions. \\nThis approach comprises a 3D-CNN model that learns \\nhierarchical representation of features with a convolu-\\ntional pathway and some unpooling layers with a \\ndeconvolutional pathway. These convolutional layers \\nare used for the calculation of features for segmenta-\\ntion. When compared to other methods, this method \\nwas shown to be superior in terms of absolute volume \\ndifference, DSC and false-positive rate.\\nA new algorithm for predicting the course of disease \\nin MS patients was developed by Zhao et al.38 using \\nclinical data relating to expanded disability status \\nscores (EDSS) collected every 6 months for the \\nCLIMB study. The Comprehensive Longitudinal MS \\ntrial at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Partners \\nMS Centre (CLIMB) has been enrolling patients since \\n2000. At the time of writing, this dataset consisted of \\n1693 patients with an average age of 43.88 years. \\nThese comprised 1228 females and 465 males. \\nHowever, 919 of these patients had an EDSS score \\nof ⩽1.5, 539 patients had an EDSS score of between \\n2 and 4, while 235 patients had an EDSS score of ⩾4. \\nThey investigated different ML algorithms, including \\nSVM, LG and SVMs with linear and non-linear fil-\\nters, with the objective of classifying MS patients as \\neither stable or deteriorating after 5 years of follow-\\nup. They found that ML algorithms, such as LG and \\nSVMs, were best in predicting EDSS after the first \\nyear, reporting a specificity of 65% and a sensitivity \\nof 62%. When data from the second year were \\nincluded, these figures increased to 68% and 71%, \\nrespectively.\\nTheir later use of non-uniform classification resulted \\nin improvements of up to 86%. An ML platform \\ndeveloped by the data analytics company IQuity can \\nidentify MS and then predict and monitor disease pro-\\ngression even for large cohorts of patients.\\nFuture developments\\nMost existing algorithms need improvement with \\nareas, such as image retrieval, management of phys-\\nical objects with long short-term memory (LSTMs), \\nAI surgical robots, prognostication and reinforce-\\nment learning still needing a lot of attention. \\nGenerative adversarial networks (GAN) based on \\nMS MRI data are being proposed which is remark-\\nable in itself. This technique is used to generate new \\ndata that have the same characteristics and statistics \\nas the training set. CNNs and GAN can help to \\ndetect lesions without the need of Gd and can thus \\ncreate a much cheaper and – for the patients – a \\nmuch safer approach.\\nA study by Gong et al.9 involved a reduced dose of Gd \\nin contrast-enhanced MS MRI scans analyzed with \\nthe help of DL. Their methodology involved the col-\\nlection of two contrast-enhanced datasets from each \\nof 60 patients, one collected after a full dose of Gd \\nand the other after low dose of Gd. Each dataset was \\nthen analyzed for active lesions being detected in the \\nlow-dose Gd scans. More specifically, by applying \\ntheir algorithm, up to 90% less Gd could be used with \\nno resultant significant degradation in image quality. \\nIt is hoped that in the future, the use of GAN will \\nallow Gd to be omitted from the procedure entirely, \\nwhich will thus lead to improvements in scanning \\ntimes and cost-effectiveness.\\nConclusion\\nAI algorithms have had a major impact on medical \\nimaging with new doors being opened in the identifi-\\ncation of textural and morphological patterns. This \\nimpact has been keenly felt particularly in the study of \\nMS, a complex disease characterized by substantial \\nphenotypic variation that occurs due to environmental \\nand genetic factors. ML/DL has delivered exceptional \\nperformance across several applications in the diag-\\nnosis of MS, with improvements being noted in the \\ndetection and segmentation of lesions, early detection \\nof disease and prognosis for MS patients. SVMs, \\nregression techniques and more advanced techniques, \\nsuch as CNNs, are examples of ML that have been \\napplied in the study of MS. Different AI techniques, \\nsuch as SVM, CNN, LG, and RF, as shown in Figures \\n6 and 7, have helped the medical field to either clas-\\nsify disease, to detect lesions and segment tissue, or \\npredict the course of disease. These approaches will \\nmake the diagnosis of MS and prediction of disease \\noutcome easier and more efficient for neurologists \\nwhich ultimately will lead to improved outcomes for \\npatients.'),\n",

The complex system of pathological events driving\\n“chronic” worsening is likely linked with the early accumulation of compartmentalized inﬂammation within the central\\nnervous system as well as insufﬁcient repair phenomena and mitochondrial failure. These mechanisms are partially\\nlesion-independent and differ from those causing clinical relapses and the formation of new focal demyelinating\\nlesions; they lead to neuroaxonal dysfunction and death, myelin loss, glia alterations, andﬁnally, a neuronal network\\ndysfunction outweighing central nervous system (CNS) compensatory mechanisms.

Most patients (/C2485%) present with a\\nrelapsing– remitting (RR) course, characterized by acute\\nattacks followed by complete or partial recovery, and even-\\ntually experience progressive accumulation of irreversible\\ndisability1 in the later stage of the disease (secondary pro-\\ngressive [SP] MS). While this phenotypic distinction\\nenhances homogeneity in clinical trials and allows standard-\\nized communication among clinicians, emerging evidence\\nsuggests a biological continuum in which pathological mech-\\nanisms underlying relapses and progression coexist from the\\nearly stage of the disease.2– 5 Despite the successful therapeu-\\ntic suppression of relapses and magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI) active inﬂammatory lesions (Fig2A– D), MS patients\\noften report a gradual but progressive worsening of physical\\nand cognitive functions. This discrepancy indicates an ongo-\\ning “smoldering” biological activity, albeit challenging to\\ndetect, which is commonly referred to as progression inde-\\npendent of relapsing activity (PIRA)2 or silent progression,6\\nand is distinct from relapse-associated worsening (RAW).\\nIn the pooled analysis of the OPERA trials, in both\\nthe ocrelizumab and interferon-treated groups, PIRA events\\naccounted for disability accumulation in a substantial pro-\\nportion (>80%) of RRMS patients despite their relatively\\nshort disease duration (mean six years).2 A large pooled\\nclinical trials dataset3 and recent data from a real-world\\nobservational cohort 5 conﬁrmed this ﬁnding. Among\\npatients from the Italian MS registry experiencing disease\\nworsening, PIRA was more commonly reported than RAW\\nsince the second year after the disease onset. Furthermore,\\nits frequency proportionally increased with the disease dura-\\ntion.5 Notably, patients free of ongoing in ﬂammatory\\nattacks can also experience signiﬁcant deterioration of their\\ncognitive function from the earliest disease stages,7,8 which\\naccumulates silently for several years.9 However, PIRA has\\nhistorically referred to progression independent of clinical\\nrelapses but inadequately captures subclinical disease activity\\naccounting for disease worsening. Indeed, the emerging def-\\ninition of PIRA includes new asymptomatic brain and spi-\\nnal cord lesions PIRMA (progression independent of\\nrelapse and MRI activity), thus aligning to outcomes mea-\\nsures used in MRI research and trials.\\nThe effective suppression of acute in ﬂammatory\\nparameters (relapses and active MRI lesions) might falsely\\nindicate disease control while underlying biological mecha-\\nnisms leading to a subtle deterioration remain clinically\\nundetected. Understanding mechanisms and identifying\\nbiomarkers of such silent deterioration remain essential\\nunmet needs.\\nPathological Substrates\\nImmunopathologically, it is plausible to hypothesize that\\nthe smoldering MS activity is characterized by a continu-\\nous interplay between intrathecal (cerebrospinalﬂuid\\n[CSF] and meninges) and parenchymal chronic processes\\nof inﬂammation and neurodegeneration, which associate\\nglial activation and neuro-axonal dysfunction/loss with\\nadditional age-related pathological mechanisms.10– 14\\nA complex interaction among different immuno-\\npathogenic and neurodegenerative processes (Fig1) possi-\\nbly underlines the disease progression and includes: (1)\\nacute blood-brain barrier breakdown/brain and spinal cord\\natrophy; (2) perivascular/meningeal in ﬂammation; (3)\\nacute focal white matter (WM) lesions/ diffuse gray matter\\n(GM) lesions; (4) acute glia priming/chronic microglia\\nactivation; (5) mitochondrial damage/impaired energy pro-\\nduction; (6) loss of trophic support/ remyelination failure.\\nSeveral potential underlying mechanisms for PIRA15\\nhave been suggested in the past decade including the\\nformation of meningeal lymphoid-aggregates with the\\nassociated subpial cortical demyelination and the conse-\\nquent accumulation of neuronal damage and cortical\\natrophy, the accumulation of chronic active lesions (CAL,\\nalso termed slowly expanding, smoldering or mixed active/\\ninactive lesions); and the remyelination failure. However,\\ntheir exact extent, involvement, timing, and role still need\\nto be fully understood. Possible concomitant key drivers\\nof PIRA could also be (1) the slowly accumulating WM\\nand GM demyelination, possibly linked to the presence of\\nperivascular, meningeal, and choroid plexus inﬂammatory\\ncell inﬁltrates; (2) persistent microglial activation (driven\\nby degenerating cells and inﬂammation) contributing to\\nneuro-axonal energy failure through oxidative stress\\nmechanisms; and (3) ongoing retrograde and anterograde\\naxonal injury.\\nPrevious histological and more recent combined\\nimaging-neuropathological studies highlighted heteroge-\\nneous immunopathological patterns of active demyelin-\\nation among patients, although lesions’ homogeneity may\\nalso occur within individual patients,16– 18 possibly con-\\nverging into a ﬁnal common pathway related to chronic\\nneuronal-axonal damage and disease progression.\\nChronic Active Lesions and Iron-Related\\nChanges\\nPathologically, CAL are characterized by a rim of activated\\nmyeloid phagocytes (microglia and macrophages) with\\noccasional myelin degradation products as a sign of\\ncontinuous low-level myelin destruction.

These data\\nstrongly suggest a key role of intrathecal inﬂammation in\\nthe slow build-up of diffuse GM pathology and support\\nthe use of CSF proﬁle as a biomarker signature of progres-\\nsive GM pathology.

In addi-\\ntion, speciﬁc neuronal subpopulations may be more sus-\\nceptible to MS-related damage. Recent studies have\\nsuggested a selective vulnerability of inhibitory neuronal\\nnetworks with a preferential loss of inhibitory interneu-\\nrons in the MS cortex, potentially altering normal brain\\nnetwork functioning.75\\nSimilarly, the diffuse synaptic loss observed in MS\\nbrains is probably related to lesion-dependent and lesion-\\nindependent mechanisms. Data from animal models and\\npost-mortem MS brains suggest that acute synaptic loss is\\nassociated with in ﬂammation, which resolves and\\nis followed by synaptic re-organization.76– 83 Synapses are\\nprobably targeted by complement factors C1q and C3 and\\nremoved by activated microglia in close contact with neu-\\nrons.77,81– 85 In animal models, in ﬂammatory cytokines\\n(such as TNFα, IL-1, IFNγ) have been shown to induce\\nsynaptic alterations79,80,86 and could contribute to syn-\\naptopathy among MS patients. Beyond structural synaptic\\ndamage, inﬂammation in the CNS can lead to abnormali-\\nties in the ability of synapses to express forms of long-term\\nplasticity, such as long-term potentiation, contributing to\\nbrain network failure and disconnection.\\nLower synaptic density has been reported in GM\\nlesions compared to the normal-appearing\\nGM (NAGM),64,74,76,87 suggesting that focal demyelin-\\nation enhances long-term synaptic loss. However, the syn-\\naptic loss appears to be relatively independent of focal\\ndemyelination76,77,88 and was found to be unrelated to\\nthe extent of the neuroaxonal loss,76,77,88 suggesting the\\ncoexistence of a diffuse primary synaptic pathology, possi-\\nbly driven by the chronic inﬂammation present in the\\nGM and meninges.\\nRole of Chronic Oxidative Injury/Mitochondrial\\nDamage and Energy Deﬁcit\\nThe occurrence of an “energetic crisis” is widely recog-\\nnized as one of the key pathological mechanisms underly-\\ning the dysfunction of the neuro-axonal unit. 89\\nDemyelinated axons require more energy to operate and\\nguarantee conduction, ultimately increasing the metabolic\\ndemand.90 During demyelination, the mitochondria\\nwithin the MS plaques move from the neuronal cell body\\nto the axon, increasing the axonal mitochondrial con-\\ntent.91 Such a homeostatic response cannot fully and per-\\nsistently compensate for the increased axonal energy\\ndemand. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and the\\nfunctional activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain\\ncomplexes I and III, are decreased in the motor cortex of\\nseverely disabled MS patients,92 and multiple deletions of\\nmitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been histologically\\ndemonstrated throughout the GM in progressive MS,\\nwith respiratory-deﬁcient neurons harboring high levels of\\nclonally expanded mtDNA deletions at the single-cell\\nlevel.93 In demyelinated axons predominantly located at\\nthe edge of chronic active lesions, reduced levels of com-\\nplex IV activity have been shown, 94 together with an\\ninverse correlation between complex IV activity and mac-\\nrophage/microglial density, suggesting that soluble prod-\\nucts released by such cells might be responsible for the\\nobserved functional impairment.94,95 Reactive oxygen and\\nnitrogen species (ROS and RNS) deriving from innate\\nimmune cells, when excessively liberated, can trigger mito-\\nchondrial pathology and initiate a process of focal axonal\\nswelling, determining axon fragmentation. 96 Further\\nexperimental evidence of the contribution of mitochon-\\ndrial and energy deﬁcits comes fromﬂuid biomarker stud-\\nies. Patients with progressive MS display increased CSF\\nlevels of mtDNA,97 while CSF lactate levels correlate with\\ndisease-worsening and axonal damage markers, such as\\nneuroﬁlament light protein.98 It is worth noting that not\\nonly a condition of“virtual” hypoxia due to an increased\\nenergy demand but also the presence of“true” tissue hyp-\\noxia (i.e., oxygen de ﬁciency) has been hypothesized to\\noccur in MS. 89 Taken together, evidence suggests the\\nvicious “hypoxia-inﬂammation” cycle as a potential tar-\\nget99 for neuroprotective strategies aiming at restoring the\\nneuronal mitochondrial activity and ultimately preventing\\nthe disease progression.100\\nAlterations in Normal Appearing White and\\nGrey Matter\\nThe normal-appearing tissue of the WM (NAWM) and\\nGM is affected by axonal injury (both intrinsic and extrin-\\nsic to the tissues), gliosis, widespread diffuse microglial\\nactivation, and disrupted myelin, which displays altered\\nbiochemical and biophysical qualities. 101– 105 Normal\\ncomposition of mature myelin is essential for oligodendro-\\ncyte and axonal health, myelin ensheathment, and place-\\nment and organization of the nodes of Ranvier. 106\\nWidespread changes at the node of Ranvier, theﬂanking\\nparanodal assembly, and the juxtaparanode, are seen near\\nand far from the MS lesion. 107– 109 Notably, activated\\nmicroglia are associated with nodal disruption, where\\nattenuating microglial activation with minocycline reduces\\nnodal and paranodal damage and blocking glutamate,\\nwhich is excessively generated by activated microglia, abro-\\ngates this change.107– 109 These changes in the NAWM\\nand NAGM could contribute to clinical worsening inde-\\npendent of new inﬂammatory attacks.90,96\\n6 Volume 96, No. 1\\nANNALS of Neurology\\n 15318249, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26913 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [15/08/2024].

CSF-in ﬁltrating T cells\\nmay respond to a multiple of the abovementioned MS\\nautoantigens, but also viral epitopes from EBV129 and\\nTorque Teno Virus (TTV),130 and even HLA-DR15125\\nand immunoglobulin-derived peptides.130\\nA role of adaptive (T cell-mediated) immune mecha-\\nnisms in PIRA is indicated by T cell receptor sequencing\\nstudies that have shown clonal CD4+ and CD8+ T cell\\nexpansions in chronic active lesions131 and demonstration\\nthat a clonally expanded RASGRP2-speciﬁc CD4+ T cell\\nclone has also been found in the autoproliferating\\nT cell compartment in the periphery.116 A contribution to\\nchronic active lesions and PIRA is further supported by a\\nsingle-cell RNA sequencing study, which showed that\\nlymphocyte activation and proinﬂammatory markers con-\\ntribute to their immune signature.23 Finally, a correlation\\nexists between lymphocyte inﬁltrates in the meninges and\\nWM lesions in progressive MS. 53 While proving the\\nrelevance of adaptive immune mechanisms for PIRA is\\nchallenging, the above observations indicate that they\\nmight be involved.\\nFocus on the Role of B Cells.The clinical efﬁcacy of B cell\\ndepletion strategies in preventing new lesion forma-\\ntion130,132 conﬁrmed the central role of B cells in MS\\npathogenesis. Several pieces of evidence underscore the\\nclose interaction between T and B cells crosstalk and\\nthe importance of related cytokine pathways in the periph-\\nery and intrathecally in the CSF/meninges. Among these\\npathways, the expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3\\nand T-bet by CD4+ Th1 cells and B cells126,133,134, the\\ndemonstration of their ligands (CXCL10 and CXCL13)\\nand of other cytokines (LT, TNF, IFNg)59,135,136 were\\nlargely investigated in the past decade.\\nB cells are mainly seen in the subarachnoid spaces in\\nmeningeal tertiary lymphoid-like structures.10,40,48 They\\ncan also be found in the perivascular space of medium-\\nsized veins within the plaque centre, mainly in the WM\\nand, to a lesser extent, in the GM.137,138 In these intrace-\\nrebral niches, B cells may contribute to compartmentalized\\ninﬂammation by perpetuating humoral immune response,\\nantigen presentation, and release of proinﬂammatory and\\ncytotoxic mediators.139,140 Supernatants from cultured B\\ncells from MS patients were toxic and induced more signiﬁ-\\ncant apoptosis in cultured neurons and oligodendrocytes\\nthan supernatants from cultured B cells from healthy con-\\ntrols.139,140 The same antigen-experienced B cell clones\\nwere found in meningeal immune cell inﬁltrates, the CSF\\nand perivascular parenchymal lesions.141– 143 In addition, it\\nhas been demonstrated that B cell clones are bidirectionally\\nexchanged between the CNS and the periphery and that\\nafﬁnity maturation occurs on both sides of the blood– brain\\nbarrier.144 More recently, a study in mouse models\\nsuggested that meningeal B cells encompass multiple stages\\nof development and may originate in calvaria and then\\ninﬁltrate and maturate in the meninges via a network of\\nchannels uncoupled from the systemic circulation. 145\\nJuly 2024 7\\nCalabrese et al: PIRA in Multiple Sclerosis\\n 15318249, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26913 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [15/08/2024].

All theseﬁndings suggest that the same stimuli might\\nbe involved in both initial B cell activation and clonal\\nexpansion events and then in the chronic invasion of differ-\\nent niches of the CNS.112\\nRole of Innate Immunity\\nFocus on Microglia. Many pro-inﬂammatory mechanisms\\nhave been suggested to be involved in active demyelin-\\nation and neurodegeneration. Still, the production of reac-\\ntive oxygen species appears particularly important. In\\ncontrast to rodent models, NADPH oxidase (Nox2)\\nexpression in human microglia and macrophages is promi-\\nnent, while the iNOS expression is sparse. This is associ-\\nated with a profound acute oxidative injury in neurons\\nand glia in active lesions.149 In the earliest descriptions of\\nMS pathology in the late 19th century, it was already\\nnoted that active demyelination and neurodegeneration in\\nMS lesions are closely associated with activated microglia\\nand macrophages. A subset of microglia and macrophages\\nat the edge of chronic active lesions contain iron and can\\nbe visualized in vivo with MRI.20 Such an iron rim is a\\nmarker for the slow expansion of lesions, relevant for silent\\nor overt disease progression in MS.28\\nNew markers became available during the past few\\nyears, allowing us to differentiate between activated\\nmicroglia and recruited myeloid cells within the lesions.\\nThey suggest most phagocytes in active MS lesions are\\nderived from the microglia pool.24\\nRecent spatial transcriptomics or proteomics studies\\nconﬁrmed the ﬁndings, which had been elucidated before\\nwith conventional methodology. 23,150,151 They provide\\nevidence of a profound heterogeneity of microglia and\\nmacrophage phenotypes, with different compositions in\\nlesions based on variable contributions of active demyelin-\\nation, inactive lesions or remyelination. Whether these\\ndifferent cell phenotypes reﬂect genuine cellular subpopu-\\nlations or the transition between naïve, pro-inﬂammatory\\nand anti-inﬂammatory cells is a question that remains\\nunresolved. Meningeal inﬂammation in progressive MS\\npatients was recently found to induce phenotypic changes\\nin cortical microglia that are differentially associated with\\nneurodegeneration.82\\nFocus on the Role of Complement. Complement is a key\\ncomponent of the innate immune system. The microglia\\nsynthesize, activate, and respond rapidly to soluble and\\nmembrane-bound products of complement activation.151\\nGenetic variants in the complement genes are associated\\nwith a more severe clinical outcome, 23,152,153 and\\nincreased complement activation is reported in cohorts\\nthat experienced a worsening progressive MS\\ncourse.42,84,154,155 Complement expression is induced in\\ncortical glia in a chronic leptomeningeal in ﬂammation\\nmodel. Complement contributes to compartmentalized\\ninﬂammation by co-activating microglia and astroglia, rec-\\nruiting circulating lymphocytes and macrophages, and\\ndriving synaptic, neuritic, and myelin degenera-\\ntion.23,59,156– 161\\nBiomarkers of Silent Disease Activity\\nImaging Biomarkers\\nParamagnetic Rim Lesions and Slowly Expanding\\nLesions\\nThe persistent microglia/macrophage activity within the\\nrim of CAL (Fig2K1) and the associated axonal damage\\nmight represent 1 of the key components of the continu-\\nous, hidden, and deleterious inﬂammatory activity driving\\nPIRA in MS. Over the past decade, an increasing clinical\\ninterest has been devoted to the detection of CAL as they\\nare associated with higher disease severity and brain and\\nspinal cord atrophy, thus representing a negative prognos-\\ntic indicator for clinical worsening and disease progres-\\nsion.31,162– 164\\nA subset of CAL can now be visualized using\\nsusceptibility-sensitive MRI sequences, that is, T2* and\\nphase contrast, R2* (Fig 2K2,K3) or quantitative suscepti-\\nbility mapping (QSM), as non-enhancing lesions with a\\nparamagnetic rim (termed “paramagnetic rim lesions” or\\nPRL). MRI-neuropathological studies consistently showed\\nthat the magnetic susceptibility contrast at the lesion rim\\nis mainly related to iron accumulation within activated\\nmicroglia/macrophages.20,26,162,165– 167\\nWhile activated microglia/macrophages play a crucial\\nrole in myelin and debris clearance (a critical step for\\nrepair and remyelination), in the context of the highly\\ninﬂammatory and dysregulated environment at the CAL\\nedge, these immune cell populations are believed to be\\nexerting a further detrimental role, as recently demon-\\nstrated by single-nucleus RNAseq phenotyping.23\\nA recent pooled-data analysis of 31 published MRI\\nstudies highlighted that PRL are present in /C2450% of\\nrelapsing and /C2460% of progressive patients.168 Compared\\nto non-PRL, PRL are more destructive lesions, as reﬂected\\nby signi ﬁcantly longer T1 times, decreased R2 *,169\\nreduced myelin water fractions, and low neurite dispersion\\nindex.166,170 In longitudinal MRI studies, PRL has been\\nfound to persist for years,171 and a subset of them slowly\\nexpand over time. 20,162 Little is known regarding the\\n8 Volume 96, No. 1\\nANNALS of Neurology\\n 15318249, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26913 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [15/08/2024].

A possible explanation for the discrepancy\\nbetween the 2 biomarkers is that a subset of SEL has low\\niron content and, therefore, is not visible as PRL. In addi-\\ntion, recent imaging studies validated that not all CALs\\ncorrespond to SELs or PRLs. Still, when PRLs are co-\\nlocalized with SELs, they show expansion and worsening\\nmicrostructural damage over time,179 supporting a key\\nrole of smoldering in ﬂammation in accumulating neu-\\nrodegeneration and disease progression.179\\nBrain and Grey Matter Atrophy\\nMRI changes in brain volume have proven clinical rele-\\nvance in MS (Fig 2H1– H10) as a marker of irreversible\\ntissue loss (i.e., brain atrophy). 180 Several studies have\\nconsistently shown that brain atrophy rates are higher in\\npatients with MS than in healthy subjects since the earliest\\ndisease stage. Atrophy appears diffuse in the MS brain and\\nspinal cord, particularly in subcortical and cortical regions,\\npossibly reﬂecting the early neuroaxonal involvement.181\\nCompared with clinically stable patients, patients\\nwith PIRA had an increased rate of brain volume loss,\\nmainly driven by cerebral GM loss (Fig 2H1– H10).\\nMoreover, MS patients with PIRA had similar brain\\natrophy6 and cortical thinning and deep GM volume loss\\nrates182 to those patients experiencing disability accumula-\\ntion due to relapses. Interestingly, these studies indepen-\\ndently suggested that atrophy rates could be partially\\ndissociated from relapse activity and likely to reﬂect mech-\\nanisms leading to the silent progression of MS.\\nComplementary to the brain atrophy assessment, the\\n‘brain-age’ paradigm183 utilizes the relationship between\\ndisease and healthy brain structural ageing to understand\\nthe impact of diseases. The difference between an\\nindividual’s chronological age and the brain-predicted age\\n(brain-PAD or brain age gap) has been proposed as an\\nage-adjusted index of structural brain health. Using 3D\\nT1-weighted MRI and machine learning algorithms, the\\nbrain-age paradigm offers the advantage of setting a sub-\\nject’s state in the context of a normal population with an\\neasily interpreted ﬁgure. MS has a pronounced effect on\\nthe brain-PAD metric, indicative of poor structural brain\\nhealth. Furthermore, measures of brain-predicted age\\nincrease more rapidly than usual chronological ageing in\\nboth RR and progressive MS, implying that the brain-age\\napproach is sensitive to accelerations in MS brain atro-\\nphy.184 Recently, brain age was associated with the wors-\\nening of the Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT)\\nperformance.185\\nFocal Cortical Demyelination\\nSubstantial immunopathological (Fig 2F1) and imaging\\n(Fig 2F2) evidence conﬁrmed that focal demyelination\\noccurs in MS since the early phases of the disease within\\nboth the cortical and deep GM, accumulates over time\\nand provides a good clinical correlate in terms of disability\\naccumulation.10,36,54,101,186\\nCLs are at least partly independent of WM acute\\ndemyelination88,187 and usually do not show contrast\\nenhancement.36 The focal cortical damage is associated\\nwith a progression of physical and cognitive disability\\nindependently of relapse186,188– 190 and its occurrence at\\nclinical onset predicts a greater risk of disability progres-\\nsion.186,190– 192\\nA 30-year longitudinal study indicated the focal cor-\\ntical demyelination as 1 of the primary substrates of dis-\\nease progression, with CLs’ burden alone explaining 43%\\nof the variance of the expanded disability status scale\\n(EDSS).89 On the contrary, a study on“benign MS” rev-\\nealed that after 15 years of the disease, those patients who\\nstill demonstrated scarce disability progression and cogni-\\ntive preservation showed a remarkably lower CLs number\\ncompared to early RRMS.192 In line with these data, the\\nlesions of deep GM, especially the thalamic lesions, have\\nbeen associated with disability progression being greater in\\nprogressive MS compared to RRMS.193\\nJuly 2024 9\\nCalabrese et al: PIRA in Multiple Sclerosis\\n 15318249, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26913 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [15/08/2024].

The prognostic relevance of isolated spinal\\ncord lesions (SCL) for developing a progressive disease\\ncourse has been shown by studying extreme disease cases.\\nPatients with solitary demyelinating lesions involving the\\nspinal cord or cervical-medullary/brainstem regions devel-\\noped an early progressive disease course.195 In addition, in\\nsubjects with radiological isolated syndrome (RIS), SCL\\nincreased the risk of evolving to PPMS rather than\\nRRMS.196 From the analysis of conventional MRI\\nsequences, a few imaging features have been identiﬁed that\\ncan contribute to the early identiﬁcation of those patients\\nwho will develop a progressive MS course or accumulate\\nmore severe disability. These include the presence of dif-\\nfuse signal hyperintensities on proton-density weighted\\nsequences (i.e., abnormal areas of intermediate signal\\nintensity between that of focal lesions and normal-\\nappearing spinal cord, lacking a well-demarcated border\\nfrom the adjacent normal-appearing cord)197,198 and the\\ninvolvement of cord central GM (Fig2J1– J3).199– 201 Har-\\nboring spinal cord lesions is an important prognostic fac-\\ntor in identifying CIS patients with a shorter time to\\nconversion to MS,202 more severe accumulation of clinical\\ndisability203 and evolution to SPMS after 15 years of\\nfollow-up.204 Using quantitative MRI techniques, such as\\nmagnetisation transfer MRI,205 a gradient of microstruc-\\ntural damage in the outer surface of the cord, which might\\nreﬂect the presence of subpial demyelination, was found\\nin patients with MS and was more severe among those\\nwith a progressive phenotype. A recent 7 T study206\\nfound that SCL have a greater propensity to occur closer\\nto the central canal and subpial CSF interfaces, with a dif-\\nferent behavior according to MS clinical phenotype (more\\ninvolvement of central canal in progressive MS and of the\\nouter subpial surface in RRMS).\\nIn addition to focal demyelinating lesions, irrevers-\\nible tissue loss (i.e., atrophy) in the spinal cord can be seen\\namong MS patients. Spinal cord atrophy (Fig 2I1– I3)\\noccurs in all MS clinical phenotypes, is more pronounced\\nand diffuse in progressive rather than relapsing MS\\npatients, is associated with concurrent clinical disability\\nand tends to progress over time.207,208 While a signiﬁcant\\nrelationship is present between cord atrophy and accumu-\\nlating disability in the short-term,209– 211 it disappears at\\nlonger clinical follow-up (more than 10 years), suggesting\\nthat spinal cord atrophy may be critical for clinical deteri-\\noration in theﬁrst years of the disease. However, it might\\nsubsequently reach a ceiling effect.212– 214 A recent study\\nwith 12 years of follow-up found that RRMS patients\\nwho developed SPMS had faster cord atrophy rates\\n(/C02.19% per year) at least 4 years before conversion com-\\npared to those patients who remained RRMS (/C00.88%\\nper year).214 A faster spinal cord atrophy rate was associ-\\nated with a shorter time to silent progression and SPMS\\nconversion, challenging the traditional dichotomy of an\\nRRMS and subsequent SPMS phenotype.\\nNew Promising Imaging Biomarkers to Identify\\nthe Disease Progression\\nThe Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density\\nImaging. The neurite orientation dispersion and density\\nimaging (NODDI) is a diffusion-weighted multi-shell\\nMRI model that provides speci ﬁc measures of tissue\\nmicrostructure (Fig 2E2). These include the intracellular\\nvolume fraction (ICV_f)/neurite density index (NDI),\\nreﬂecting neurite density, and orientation dispersion index\\n(ODI), quantifying neurite orientation variability and tis-\\nsue coherence and complexity.215 In a recent study, PRL\\nshowed decreased myelin water fraction but also NDI\\nrelative to lesions without a rim,216 conﬁrming the patho-\\nlogical evidence of ongoing demyelination and axonal\\ndamage in these lesions.34,217 Signiﬁcantly lower ICV_f/NDI\\nin the NAWM218,219 and cortex,216,218– 220 and ODI in the\\ncortex219,220 were found in progressive compared to RRMS\\npatients, and they correlated with more severe clinical dis-\\nability, thus conﬁrming in vivo that a clinically relevant\\nprogressive neurite loss and a simpliﬁcation of dendritic\\narborization may contribute to the disease severity.219,220\\nConstrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) is\\nanother diffusion-weighted multi-shell MRI model that\\nallows to deﬁne the ﬁber-bundle cross-section area, a\\nmarker of axonal shrinkage/loss across a plane perpendicu-\\nlar to the ﬁber-bundle axis that may better quantify the\\ndegeneration of the WM ﬁber-bundles.221,222 A signiﬁ-\\ncant reduction ofﬁber-bundle cross-section area, gradually\\nworsening over 1 year and reﬂecting more severe WM\\ntract volume loss, has been found in progressive compared\\nto RRMS patients,223,224 mainly involving clinically rele-\\nvant WM tracts, including the cerebellar peduncles, the\\ncortico-spinal tract, the cingulum and the corpus\\n10 Volume 96, No. 1\\nANNALS of Neurology\\n 15318249, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26913 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [15/08/2024].

Leptomeningeal enhance-\\nment (LME, (Fig2E2), Fig 2G1– G3), typically visualized\\non delayed post-contrast FLAIR MRI, has been recently\\nexplored as a biomarker for blood-meningeal barrier open-\\ning and meningeal inﬂammation in MS.10,229\\nLME detection on post-contrast 7 T FLAIR is more\\nprevalent than on 3 T FLAIR, occurs at frequencies closer\\nto histopathologic data and allows the investigation of the\\nrelationship between meningeal inﬂammation and cortical\\npathology.230\\nTwo patterns of LME have been described:“nodular”,\\nwith discrete, spherical nodules at the pial surface or\\nsubarachnoid space, and“spread/ﬁll” with the appearance\\nof contrast spread through the local subarachnoid\\nspace.230 In a recent meta-analysis including 1,605 MS\\npatients, the proportion of patients with LME was higher\\nin progressive than in the relapsing MS group (39.8%\\nvs. 53.4%).231 LME is associated with a more severe MS\\ncourse and disease progression,230,232– 235 with the extent\\nof cortical, 234 thalamic,234 and hippocampal 236 lesions\\nand with the rate of brain and cortical atro-\\nphy.230,232,233,236 However, LME is not speciﬁc to MS, as\\nit has also been described in aged healthy con-\\ntrols230,237,238 as well as in patients with other inﬂamma-\\ntory and infective neurologic conditions.231,237,239– 241\\nPositron Emission Tomography. Using radiotracers binding\\nto the TSPO, a mitochondrial protein upregulated in acti-\\nvated microglial/macrophage and astrocytes activation, sev-\\neral PET studies have consistently demonstrated that\\nincreased glial activation could be detected not only in\\nactive WM lesions but also, to a lesser extent, in CLs, and\\na subset of chronic WM lesions (possibly CAL).32,242– 249\\nThe number and volume of lesions with positive PET\\nTSPO uptake were higher in progressive than in RRMS\\npatients and correlated with the development of clinical\\ndisability242 and with WM lesions accumulation.

They\\nwere found reduced in layer II of the primary motor cor-\\ntex of MS patients, particularly within the NAGM.92\\nIncreased CSF PVALB levels in MS have been demon-\\nstrated to reﬂect interneuron loss, cortical atrophy, and\\nsevere cognitive decline in MS patients, both at the time\\nof diagnosis and, increasing with progression, at the\\ntime of death.136\\nInﬂammatory Biomarkers of Glia Activity and\\nChronic Inﬂammation\\nIn addition to speciﬁc markers of neuronal damage, several\\ninﬂammatory biomarkers related to glial or immune cell\\nactivity in MS have been recently analyzed, and at the\\nmoment, a wide range of new biomarkers that can predict\\ndisability progression, monitor disease activity, and assess\\ntreatment response have been proposed.\\nAlthough kappa free light chain (KFLC) index has\\nbecome a useful diagnostic biomarker in MS, in a very\\nrecent retrospectively identiﬁed based on 131 patients\\nwith clinically isolated syndrome or early RRMS, the\\nKFLC index was observed to be signiﬁcantly higher in\\nPIRA compared with non-PIRA.258\\nSerum levels of glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein\\n(sGFAP), a protein highly expressed by astrocytes, were\\nassociated with disease progression in RRMS,259 and dis-\\nability worsening in PP 260; more recently, in a study\\nincluding 355 patients and 259 healthy controls, patients\\nwith worsening progressive MS showed 50.9% higher\\nsGFAP levels compared with those with stable MS\\nsuggesting that GFAP can be a prognostic biomarker for\\nfuture PIRA.261 Differently from sNFL, sGFAP does not\\ntypically elevate during acute in ﬂammation but reﬂects\\naccelerated GM brain volume loss and is associated with a\\nhigher risk of conﬁrmed disability worsening.261 Notably,\\nGFAP age and sex speciﬁc normal ranges are advocated as\\nwell as a“gold standard” detection method.260\\nIncreased CSF levels of activin A, a molecule\\nexpressed by activated microglia (42), which is part of the\\nsenescence-associated secretome, may indicate that MS\\npatients enter an early inﬂammation process that could be\\nat least partly responsible for the silent disease activity\\namong MS patients older than 45 years.55\\nWhile IL12p40 and CHI3L1, expressed by immune\\ncells of the myeloid lineage, have been proposed as prom-\\nising CSF biomarkers of MS lesional activity,262 increased\\nCSF levels of CHI3L1 have been speciﬁcally observed in\\npatients with a higher burden of chronic active lesions.263\\nIn addition, speciﬁc CSF protein proﬁles, including high\\nprotein levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines (TNFa, IFNg,\\nIL6), molecules involved in lymphoid neogenesis\\n(CXCL12, CXCL13, TNF), and B cell and plasma cell/\\nblast activity (IL6, IL10, TNF, BAFF, APRIL, LIGHT,\\nTWEAK), were found associated with elevated GM lesion\\nload either in progressive post-mortem MS cases or in\\nnaive MS patients at the time of diagnosis.135 The same\\nCSF inﬂammatory pattern was proposed to predict a\\nhigher risk of disease activity and more severe cortical\\ndamage.136 A composite biomarker study on a large and\\nmulticenter MS population could validate all the previous\\nstudies to better identify each patient’s disease state since\\nthe diagnosis is needed. A new approach integrating all\\nthe serum and CSF analyses of an extensive pattern of bio-\\nmarkers with demographic, clinical, imaging, cellular,\\nmetabolomics, microbiome, genomics, and proteomics\\ndata with new bioinformatics and machine learning will\\nhelp to identify also patient subgroups with high risk of\\nPIRA outcome.\\nConclusions for the Clinical Practice\\nIt is now clear that the pathological mechanisms underly-\\ning clinical progression begin early in the disease course.\\nHowever, they are usually so gradual that the progression\\nis initially unnoticed by physicians.6,264\\nThe recent ﬁnding that patients with pediatric-onset\\nare less likely to exhibit PIRA over a decade of follow-up\\nmight correlate with their protection against disability,265\\npossibly for repair capacity and for the different immuno-\\npathological mechanisms.\\nThe accuracy in PIRA detection is also challenged\\nby concurrent relapses with variable degrees of recovery,\\nraising the need to monitor patients with additional visits\\nthat become necessary, mainly when deﬁning conﬁrmed\\ndisability accumulation at 3- or 6-month follow-up.\\nComposite measures, including T25FW and 9HPT,\\nshould be adopted, given the notable percentage of dis-\\nability accumulation detected by such measures.2\\nAll the studies so far available,2,3,5,6 clearly suggested\\nthe need for strict clinical monitoring based on cognitive\\nevaluation, which includes measures of information\\nprocessing speed (as SDMT).

The role of progression independent of relapse activity in early multiple sclerosis is yet to be established. The ob-\\njective of this multicentre, observational, retrospective cohort study was to investigate the contribution of relapse-asso-\\nciated worsening and progression independent of relapse activity to conﬁrmed disability accumulation in patients with\\nclinically isolated syndrome and early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, assessed within one year from onset and\\nwith follow-up≥5y e a r s(n = 5169). Data were extracted from the Italian Multiple Sclerosis Register. Conﬁrmed disability\\naccumulation was deﬁned by an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale score conﬁrmed at 6 months, and classiﬁed\\nper temporal association with relapses. Factors associated with progression independent of relapse activity and relapse-\\nassociated worsening were assessed using multivariable Cox regression models. Over a follow-up period of 11.5 ± 5.5\\nyears, progression independent of relapse activity occurred in 1427 (27.6%) and relapse-associated worsening in 922\\n(17.8%) patients. Progression independent of relapse activity was associated with older age at baseline [hazard\\nratio (HR) = 1.19; 95% conﬁd e n c ei n t e r v a l( C I )1 . 1 3–1.25, P < 0.001], having a relapsing–remitting course at baseline (HR =\\n1.44; 95% CI 1.28–1.61, P < 0.001), longer disease duration at baseline (HR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.28–1.90, P < 0.001), lower\\nExpanded Disability Status Scale at baseline (HR = 0.92; 95% CI 0.88–0.96, P < 0.001) and lower number of relapses before\\nthe event (HR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.73–0.80, P < 0.001). Relapse-associated worsening was associated with younger age at base-\\nline (HR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.81–0.93,P < 0.001), having a relapsing–remitting course at baseline (HR = 1.55; 95% CI 1.35–1.79,P <\\n0.001), lower Expanded Disability StatusScale at baseline (HR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.89–0.99, P = 0.017) and a higher number of\\nrelapses before the event (HR = 1.04; 95% CI 1.01–1.07, P < 0.001). Longer exposure to disease-modifying drugs was asso-\\nciated with a lower risk of both progression independent of relapse activity and relapse-associated worsening (P <\\n0.001). This study provides evidence that in an early relapsing-onset multiple sclerosis cohort, progression independent\\nof relapse activity was animportant contributor to conﬁrmeddisabilityaccumulation. Ourﬁndings indicate that insidious\\nprogression appears even in the earliest phases of the disease, suggesting that inﬂammation and neurodegeneration can\\nrepresent a single disease continuum, in which age is one of the main determinants of disease phenomenology.\\n1 Department of NEUROFARBA, University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy\\n2 Department of Neurology, IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi, 50143 Florence, Italy\\nReceived October 16, 2021.

The Italian Multiple Sclerosis Register was approved by\\nthe Policlinico of Bari Ethics Committee and by the local ethics com-\\nmittees in all participating centres. Written informed consent was\\nobtained from all enrolled patients in accordance with the\\nDeclaration of Helsinki. The minimum data set required for this\\nstudy also comprised the main demographic characteristics, the\\ndate of disease onset, clinical course, follow-up visit dates,\\nExpanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)6 scores recorded at each\\nvisit, the date of all relapses, start and end dates of all DMTs and\\nDMT type. Quality assurance through online certiﬁcation of EDSS\\ncompetency is required at each participating site. Inclusion criteria\\nwere: patients with aﬁrst neurological evaluation within 1 year\\nfrom the ﬁrst demyelinating event; CIS or RR course at theﬁrst\\nneurological evaluation; a minimum of three visits with EDSS\\nevaluation; a minimum of 5 years follow-up. We excluded patients\\nwith a PP and SP course at theﬁrst neurological evaluation and\\nthose enrolled in randomized controlled trials. The baseline was\\ndeﬁned as theﬁrst neurological evaluation with EDSS scoring. If\\nthe ﬁrst evaluation occurred within 30 days from a relapse, baseline\\nwas deﬁned as the following assessment with EDSS scoring per-\\nformed outside of a relapse and within theﬁrst year from disease\\nonset. When re-baseline was not possible, patients were excluded.\\nMultiple sclerosis duration was calculated from theﬁrst demyelin-\\nating event. The follow-up time was deﬁned as the time between\\nthe ﬁrst and last available EDSS entry.\\nConﬁrmed disability accrual (CDA) was deﬁned as ≥24-week\\nconﬁrmed disability increase from study baseline, measured by\\nEDSS (increase≥1.5 points if baseline EDSS = 0; increase≥1.0 point\\nif baseline EDSS≥1.0 and ≤5.5; increase ≥0.5 point if baseline\\nEDSS ≥6.0). The date of CDA was assigned at theﬁrst EDSS score\\nat which an increase occurred. RAW events were deﬁned as a sub-\\nset of CDA events. In these, the initial disability increase from study\\nbaseline occurred≤90 days after or≤30 days before the onset of a\\nrelapse. Otherwise, PIRA was deﬁned as a CDA event occurring\\n>90 days after and >30 days before the onset of a relapse.\\nIn a subgroup of patients with an MRI assessment≤90 days be-\\nfore or≤30 days after the CDA, progression independent of relapse\\nand radiological activity (true PIRA) was deﬁned as a CDA event oc-\\ncurring >90 days after and >30 days before the onset of a relapse and\\nthe presence of disease activity at the MRI evaluation (T1\\ngadolinium-enhancing lesions and/or T2 new/enlarging lesions).\\nOtherwise, CDA events occurring≤90 days after or≤30 days before\\nthe onset of a relapse and/or the presence of disease activity at the\\nMRI evaluation were deﬁned as relapse and/or radiological activity\\nassociated worsening (true RAW).\\nA relapse was deﬁned as the occurrence of new symptoms or the\\nexacerbation of existing symptoms that persisted for 24 h or more\\nin the absence of concurrent illness or fever and that occurred 30\\ndays or more after a previous relapse.7\\nTransition to SP was deﬁned according to the following deﬁni-\\ntions: (i) The neurologist deﬁnition, based on the subjective deci-\\nsion made by the neurologists according to the Lublin criteria for\\nSP.8,9 For this deﬁnition, the date of SP conversion assigned by the\\nneurologists was used. (ii) A data-driven algorithm based on a pre-\\nvious published deﬁnition10 with some modiﬁcations: a PIRA event\\nwith a minimum EDSS score of 4.0 at the time of conversion to SP\\nmultiple sclerosis and at the end of follow-up (ﬁnal EDSS≥4.0).\\nFor this deﬁnition, the date of PIRA event was assigned to SP\\nconversion.\\nFor DMT exposure, the proportion of time during which patients\\nreceived DMT was deﬁned by the recorded starting and ending\\ndates. The total time a patient spent on treatment was calculated in-\\ncluding any switches and gaps in treatment. We did not consider\\ngaps <3 months as a therapy interruption. For DMT in which ex-\\ntended treatment effects are recognized, the estimated treatment\\neffect duration was used to calculate the proportion of time that pa-\\ntients received therapy (6 months for mitoxantrone, rituximab,\\nocrelizumab; 5 years for alemtuzumab and autologous haematopoi-\\netic stem-cell transplantation; 2 months for natalizumab; 12\\nmonths for cladribine).11\\nThe following sensitivity analyses were carried out: (i) by includ-\\ning patients with the ﬁrst neurological evaluation on or after\\n1 January 2000; and (ii) CDA events were reclassiﬁed considering a\\ntime window of 365 days instead of 90 days as previously speciﬁed.\\nStatistical analysis\\nThe baseline and follow-up characteristics were expressed as mean\\nand SD or frequency and percentage for continuous and categorical\\ncovariates, respectively. Categorical and continuous variables were\\ncompared by using chi2 statistic, Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–\\nWallis tests, as appropriate.\\nFactors associated with ofﬁrst 24-week CDA (PIRA or RAW) and\\ntransition to SP were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional\\nhazard regressions. The proportional hazard assumption was as-\\nsessed through graphical inspection of residuals and scaled\\nSchoenfeld residuals test. In case of assumption violation, inter-\\naction terms between the covariates and time were added to the\\nmodel.12 The date of theﬁrst visit with full EDSS evaluation was\\nused as time origin of the model. In the absence of outcome occur-\\nrence, data were censored at the latest EDSS available. The expos-\\nure time was censored at the reaching of the outcome or at the\\nlast visit. Results of Cox regression models were expressed as haz-\\nard ratio (HR) and 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) of reaching the out-\\ncomes. The multivariable modelling analyses on theﬁrst 24-week\\nCDA (PIRA and RAW) were adjusted for the following covariates:\\nsex (female versus male), symptom at onset (multifocal versus uni-\\nfocal), age atﬁrst visit (≤20, 21–30, 31–40, 41–50, 51–60, ≥61 years),\\ndisease duration atﬁrst visit, disease course (RR versus CIS) and\\nEDSS score atﬁrst visit, number of relapses before the event, per-\\ncentage of time spent on DMT before the event, number of EDSS\\nevaluations before the event.

Characteristics of the study sample are depicted inTable 1.\\nOver a follow-up period of 11.5 ± 5.5 years, CDA occurred in 2349\\n(45.4%) patients. Patients with CDA had lower EDSS at baseline\\n(1.5/1.6 versus 1.8), longer follow-up duration (12.7/13.7 versus\\n10.1 years) and were less frequently treated with DMT during the\\nfollow-up period before the event (15.3/22.8% versus 86.7%;\\nTable 1). As for theﬁrst DMT, 2712 (93.2%) patients received plat-\\nform therapies (interferons, glatiramer acetate, teriﬂunomide, di-\\nmethyl fumarate) while 199 (6.8%) received highly effective\\ntreatments (natalizumab,ﬁngolimod, cladribine, alemtuzumab,\\nmitoxantrone, rituximab, ocrelizumab). CDA patients had higher\\nEDSS score at the end of the follow-up (3.7 versus 1.4;Table 1).\\nFactors associated withﬁrst RAW and PIRA event\\nPIRA (n = 1427) accounted for 60.7% ofﬁrst CDA and were already\\ndetectable in theﬁrst years of follow-up, becoming more frequent\\nthan RAW since the second year (Fig. 2). On the whole, 682 out of\\n1427 (47.8%)ﬁrst PIRA and 570 out of 922 (61.8%)ﬁrst RAW events\\noccurred during theﬁrst 5 years of follow-up.\\nIn the multivariable analysis, RAW was associated with younger\\nage at baseline (HR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.81–0.93, P < 0.001), having a RR\\ncourse at baseline (HR = 1.55; 95% CI 1.35–1.79, P < 0.001), lower\\nEDSS at baseline (HR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.89–0.99, P = 0.017), higher num-\\nber of relapses before the event (HR = 1.04; 95% CI 1.01–1.07,\\nP < 0.001) and shorter exposure to DMT before the event (HR = 0.16;\\n95% CI 0.12–0.20, P < 0.001;Table 2). The survival curve for the risk\\nof RAW in treated and untreated patients is reported inFig. 3A.\\nOn the other hand, in the multivariable analysis, PIRA was asso-\\nciated with older age at baseline (HR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.13–1.25,\\nP < 0.001), having a RR course at baseline (HR = 1.44; 95% CI 1.28–\\n1.61, P < 0.001), longer disease duration at baseline (HR = 1.56; 95%\\nCI 1.28–1.90, P < 0.001), lower EDSS at baseline (HR = 0.92; 95% CI\\n0.88–0.96, P < 0.001), lower number of relapses before the event\\n(HR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.73–0.80, P < 0.001) and shorter exposure to\\nDMT before the event (HR = 0.18; 95% CI 0.15 –0.22, P < 0.001;\\nTable 3). The survival curve for the risk of PIRA in treated and un-\\ntreated patients is reported inFig. 3B.\\nA subgroup of 359 of 2349 (15.3%) CDA patients had an MRI as-\\nsessment close to the event. Spinal cord MRI was available in 217\\ncases (60.4%). According to clinical deﬁnition, 187 RAW (52.1%)\\nand 172 PIRA (47.9%) occurred. Taking into account MRI activity,\\ntrue PIRA decreased to 84 (23.4%), while the remaining 275 (76.6%)\\nCDA events were reclassiﬁed as true RAW. Factors associated\\nwith true RAW and true PIRA were comparable to those of RAW\\nand PIRA (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). In particular, true RAW\\nwas associated with having an RR course at baseline (HR = 1.73;\\n95% CI 1.33–2.26, P < 0.001), lower EDSS at baseline (HR = 0.75; 95%\\nCI 0.67–0.84, P < 0.001), higher number of relapses before the event\\n(HR = 1.15; 95% CI 1.08–1.23, P < 0.001) and shorter exposure to\\nDMT before the event (HR = 0.07; 95% CI 0.05 –0.11, P < 0.001;\\nSupplementary Table 1). True PIRA was associated older age at\\nbaseline (HR = 1.45; 95% CI 1.16–1.80, P < 0.001), having an RR course\\nat baseline (HR = 2.20; 95% CI 1.33–3.65, P = 0.002), longer disease\\nduration at baseline (HR = 2.48; 95% CI 1.10–5.60, P = 0.029) and\\nshorter exposure to DMT before the event (HR = 0.10; 95% CI 0.06–\\n0.19, P < 0.001;Supplementary Table 2).\\nPIRA, RAW and risk of secondary progressive\\nmultiple sclerosis\\nOver the follow-up period, 322 (6.2%) patients transitioned to SP\\nmultiple sclerosis according to the neurologist deﬁnition (14.1% of\\nRAW and 12.9% of PIRA subjects), while 840 (16.3%) patients fulﬁlled\\nthe algorithmic deﬁnition of SP multiple sclerosis (27.0% of RAW\\nand 41.4% of PIRA subjects;Table 1).\\nFocusing on patients with one or more CDA, SP course according\\nto both deﬁnitions was associated with older age at baseline (HR =\\n1.28–1.31; 95% CI 1.15–1.49, P < 0.001), higher EDSS at baseline (HR\\n= 1.38–1.48; 95% CI 1.26–1.55, P < 0.001) and lower number of re-\\nlapses before transition (HR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.85–0.96, P ≤0.001). SP\\nmultiple sclerosis according to the neurologist deﬁnition was asso-\\nciated with a lower proportion of PIRA events before transition (HR\\n= 0.47; 95% CI 0.34–0.64, P < 0.001) and lower exposure to DMT before\\ntransition (HR = 0.25; 95% CI 0.18–0.35, P < 0.001). On the other hand,\\na higher proportion of PIRA events before transition was associated\\nwith a higher risk of SP multiple sclerosis according to the algorith-\\nmic deﬁnition (HR = 3.35; 95% CI 2.67–4.22, P < 0.001;Table 4).\\nSensitivity analyses\\nThe sensitivity analyses performed (i) by including patients with\\nthe ﬁrst neurological evaluation on or after 1 January 2000; and (ii)\\nreclassifying CDA events considering a time window of 365 days in-\\nstead of 90 days conﬁrmed the results of primary models\\n(Supplementary Tables 3–10).\\nDiscussion\\nAccumulation of disability in multiple sclerosis can occur as RAW,\\nin which disability increases in relation to an overt inﬂammatory\\nmanifestation (relapse), and as PIRA, in which‘silent’disability ac-\\ncrual takes place in the absence of clinically evident inﬂammatory\\nactivity. RAW has been historically considered as the main epiphe-\\nnomenon of RR multiple sclerosis and earliest phases of the dis-\\nease, while PIRA is regarded as the feature of more advanced\\nstages (SP multiple sclerosis) and PP multiple sclerosis.

Notably, all patients were diagnosed with CIS or RR multiple\\nsclerosis and had theﬁrst EDSS evaluation within 1 year from on-\\nset. On the one hand, this could limit the generalizability of our\\nﬁndings, as the majority of people with multiple sclerosis actually\\nattend the clinic >1 year after onset. Indeed, patients included in\\nthe present study were younger (31.8 ± 9.9 versus 37.7 ± 10.5 years,\\nP< 0.001) and less disabled (EDSS score 1.7 ± 1.2 versus 2.3 ± 1.5,P <\\n0.001) than CIS and RR multiple sclerosis subjects with aﬁrst visit\\nperformed >1 year form disease onset. On the other hand, however,\\nour cohort is ideal to establish a proof-of-principle about the role of\\nPIRA in theﬁrst years of the disease. Therefore, our data clearly\\ndemonstrate that underlying disease progression is already rele-\\nvant in the earliest phases of multiple sclerosis, suggesting that\\nthe disease could be considered as a continuum in which relapse-\\ndependent and -independent disability worsening takes place\\nsince onset. The key determinant is the way by which CDA occurs\\nappears to be age, with RAW events being more frequent in younger\\npatients and PIRA predominant in older patients.\\nThe inﬂuence of age on multiple sclerosis course has been\\nconsistently reported since the early epidemiological studies.13\\nIn the natural history cohorts, age at assignment of disability\\nlandmarks was not substantially inﬂu e n c e db yt h et y p eo ft h ei n i -\\ntial course of multiple sclerosis (be it RR or progressive) and mean\\nage at onset of the progressive phase was similar between PP\\nmultiple sclerosis and SP multiple sclerosis patients.14,15 These\\nobservations induced a unitary hypothesis,15 proposing multiple\\nsclerosis as one-stage disorder in which acute focal recurrent in-\\nﬂammation and diffuse chronic progressive neurodegeneration\\nare tightly intermingled since the outset of the disease. Several\\nstudies demonstrated the converse relationship between age\\nand number of attacks,16–18 with aﬂorid inﬂammatory activity re-\\nported in younger patients and a gradual relapse decrease in fre-\\nquency with age.\\nAt the neuropathological and immunological levels, the role\\nof age could be explained, at least in part, by immunosenes-\\ncence19 and inﬂamm-aging 20 processes.

With advancing age, immunosenescence\\ndecreases the activity and efﬁcacy of the adaptive system, while\\na ‘chronic’inﬂammatory status, mainly sustained by the innate\\nimmune system, tends to emerge. In this scenario,‘silent’neuro-\\ndegeneration and disease progression can occur. Interestingly,\\nactivation of microglia in the perilesional normal-appearing\\nwhite matter as detected by translocator protein–PET imaging\\nhas been linked to later PIRA over 4-year follow-up period. 21\\nMoreover, smouldering lesions, in which the slowly expanding\\nedge is mainly populated by activated microglia, are considered\\nas markers of the progressive phase.22 Therefore, it would be of\\ninterest to assess whether the presence of smouldering lesions\\nis associated with higher risk of PIRA.\\nA higher number of relapses was associated with RAW events,\\nwhile PIRA was related to lower relapse rate before CDA. This\\nﬁnding is not surprising, as a more ‘inﬂammatory ’ clinical\\nphenotype is more likely to determine RAW, while a lower num-\\nber of relapses reveals underlying‘silent’progression, as shown\\nin recent observations.2,4 For instance, in the pooled analysis of\\ntwo randomized clinical trials on ocrelizumab in RR multiple\\nsclerosis, the suppression of relapse activity by both interferon\\nβ-1a and ocrelizumab uncovered the presence of relentless pro-\\ngression even in a phase of the disease in which relapses usually\\ndominate. 4\\nOther factors associated with CDA, in particular the RR disease\\ncourse and lower EDSS score at baseline, were shared by both\\nRAW and PIRA and were consistent with well-acknowledged pre-\\ndictors of disability worsening in early multiple sclerosis.23\\nImportantly, a longer exposure to DMT was associated with a\\nlower risk of any CDA, independent of the phenotype. The efﬁ-\\ncacy of DMT on PIRA, in particular the superiority of ocrelizumab\\nover interferonβ-1a, has already been reported in the pooled ana-\\nlysis of OPERA-1 and OPERA-2 trials.4 While the prevention of\\nRAW is a straightforward outcome of inﬂammatory and relapse\\nactivity suppression, the effectiveness of DMT on PIRA also indi-\\ncates that‘silent’progression could be, at least in part, sustained\\nby an inﬂammatory component. It has to be noted that our study\\nis purely clinically grounded, and we cannot exclude that acute\\ninﬂammatory activity on MRI have contributed to PIRA. Indeed,\\nin the subgroup of patients in which MRI assessment close to\\nCDA was available, the proportion of true PIRA was reduced to\\n23.4% of observed CDA. However, even in this analysis, DMT\\nwas effective in reducing the risk of true PIRA, suggesting that\\ndisability worsening was still attributable to an ongoing inﬂam-\\nmatory activity.\\nIt has been argued that the same underlying process that causes\\nsilent progression could be responsible for SP multiple sclerosis\\nwhen the march of clinical worsening is more evident.2 Indeed, pa-\\ntients with PIRA were characterized by accelerated brain atrophy\\nover time,2 and PIRA has been proposed as a criterion to mark, on\\nTable 1 Characteristics of the study sample\\nFirst CDA\\nTotal n = 5169 RAWn = 922 PIRAn = 1427 No CDAn = 2820 P\\nAge at baseline, year, mean ± SD 31.8 ± 9.9 30.3 ± 9.8 34.0 ± 10.1 31.1 ± 9.6 RAW versus no CDA 0.033\\nPIRA versus no CDA <0.001\\nRAW versus PIRA <0.001\\nSex, femalen (%) 3503 (67.8) 645 (70.0) 956 (67.0) 1902 (67.4) 0.280\\nDisease course at baseline,n (%) 0.575\\nCIS 2082 (40.3) 373 (40.5) 590 (41.3) 1119 (39.7)\\nRR 3087 (59.7) 549 (59.5) 837 (58.7) 1701 (60.3)\\nDisease duration at baseline, year, mean ± SD 0.42 ± 0.27 0.42 ± 0.27 0.44 ± 0.28 0.41 ± 0.27 RAW versus no CDA 0.417\\nPIRA versus no CDA <0.001\\nRAW versus PIRA 0.313\\nEDSS at baseline, mean ± SD 1.7 ± 1.2 1.5 ± 1.1 1.6 ± 1.3 1.8 ± 1.2 RAW versus no CDA <0.001\\nPIRA versus no CDA <0.001\\nRAW versus PIRA 0.621\\nOnset topography,n (%) 0.082\\nUnifocal 4402 (85.2) 774 (83.9) 1198 (84.0) 2430 (86.2)\\nMultifocal 767 (14.8) 148 (16.1) 229 (16.0) 390 (13.8)\\nFollow-up duration, year, mean ± SD 11.5 ± 5.5 13.7 ± 6.5 12.7 ± 5.9 10.1 ± 4.5 RAW versus no CDA <0.001\\nPIRA versus no CDA <0.001\\nRAW versus PIRA 0.001\\nNumber of visits during follow-up, mean ± SD 15.4 ± 12.5 9.2 ± 8.8 11.1 ± 10.3 19.6 ± 13.0 RAW versus no CDA <0.001\\nPIRA versus no CDA <0.001\\nRAW versus PIRA <0.001\\nDMT during follow-up,n (%) 2911 (56.3) 141 (15.3) 326 (22.8) 2444 (86.7) <0.001\\nPercentage of follow-up spent on DMT, mean ± SD 46.4 ± 44.7 13.5 ± 33.0 18.8 ± 36.9 71.1 ± 35.6 RAW versus no CDA <0.001\\nPIRA versus no CDA <0.001\\nRAW versus PIRA 0.018\\nFinal EDSS, mean ± SD 2.5 ± 2.0 3.7 ± 2.2 3.7 ± 2.0 1.4 ± 1.0 RAW versus no CDA <0.001\\nPIRA versus no CDA <0.001\\nRAW versus PIRA 0.999\\nSP at follow-up,n (%) 322 (6.2) 130 (14.1) 184 (12.9) 8 (0.3) <0.001\\nAlgorithmic deﬁnition SP at follow-up,n (%) 840 (16.3) 249 (27.0) 591 (41.4) 0 (0.0) <0.001\\nSigniﬁcant P-values are highlighted in bold.\\nProgression in early multiple sclerosis BRAIN 2022: 145; 2796 –2805 | 2801\\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/145/8/2796/6553893 by guest on 12 August 2024\\n'),\n",

The neurologist deﬁnition identiﬁed\\nonly 322 (6.2%) SP patients, while the more objective deﬁnition, de-\\nrived from that proposed by Lorscheider and colleagues,10 identiﬁed\\n840 (16.3%) SP cases. Moreover, unexpectedly, in multivariable mod-\\nels, SP course according to the neurologist deﬁnition was mostly dri-\\nven by RAW events, while a higher proportion of PIRA was\\nassociated with a higher risk of SP according to the algorithmic def-\\ninition. These differences could be explained, at least in part, by the\\nselection of patients having theﬁrst visit within 1 year from disease\\nonset. It is possible that, in theﬁrst years of the disease, neurologists\\nmay be prone to misclassiﬁcation and feel hesitant to irreversibly\\nassign an SP course, signiﬁcantly narrowing the availability of\\neffective and approved DMT options.\\nIn our opinion, theseﬁndings are in line with the hypothesis of\\nmultiple sclerosis as a single disease entity, in which RAW and\\nPIRA can coexist since disease onset, both contributing to the ac-\\ncumulation of irreversible disability and the transition to the pro-\\ngressive phase. The exhaustion of compensatory mechanisms\\nand age-related neurodegeneration are likely to play a role in\\nthe onset of the formerly described‘amnesic phenomen’,24 i.e.\\nthe self-perpetuating accumulation of disability after a threshold\\nof irreversible disability has been reached, irrespective (amnesic)\\nof the prior clinical history of thedisease. Of note, in our sample,\\nbeyond the CDA event, older age at baseline, and a higher baseline\\nEDSS score were the main prognostic factors associated with a\\nhigher risk of transition to SP multiple sclerosis. These results\\nare in agreement with those from previous studies on predictors\\no ft h eo n s e to ft h ep r o g r e s s i o np h a s ef o l l o w i n gr e l a p s i n gm u l t i p l e\\nsclerosis.25–30\\nIn the interpretation of the studyﬁndings, a few limitations\\nshould be taken into account.

On\\nthe other hand, we cannot exclude that unnoticed (milder) re-\\nlapses or MRI inﬂammatory activity may have contributed to\\nPIRA events.

A deep learning architecture based on convolutional neural networks\\nwas implemented to predict: (1) clinical worsening (Expanded Disability Status\\nScale [EDSS]–based model), (2) cognitive deterioration (Symbol Digit Modali-\\nties Test [SDMT]–based model), or (3) both (EDSS + SDMT–based model).\\nThe method was tested on an independent data set and compared with the perfor-\\nmance of 2 expert physicians.\\nResults: For the test set, the convolutional neural network model showed high\\npredictive accuracy for clinical (83.3%) and cognitive (67.7%) worsening, al-\\nthough the highest accuracy was reached when training the algorithm using\\nboth EDSS and SDMT information (85.7%). Artificial intelligence classifica-\\ntion performance exceeded that of 2 expert physicians (70% of accuracy for\\nthe human raters).\\nConclusions:We developed a robust and accurate model for predicting clinical\\nand cognitive worsening of MS patients after 2 years, based on conventional\\nT2-weighted and T1-weighted brain MRI scans obtained at baseline. This algo-\\nrithm may be valuable for supporting physicians in their clinical practice for the\\nearlier identification of MS patients at risk of disease worsening.\\nKey Words:multiple sclerosis, artificial intelligence, deep learning, prognosis,\\nmagnetic resonance imaging, Italian Neuroimaging Network Initiative\\n(Invest Radiol2022;57: 423–432)\\nM\\nultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, demyelinating,\\nand neurodegenerative disease involving the central nervous sys-\\ntem of young adults in Western countries leading, in most cases, to severe\\nand irreversible clinical disability.1 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is\\none of the main in vivo tools for diagnosis and monitoring disease course\\nand treatment in MS.2 However, the prognostic value of MRI for\\npredicting disease evolution in these patients is still being debated.\\nThe possibility to predict disease progression in MS before the\\naccumulation of irreversible clinical disability would be very important\\nfor promptly managing personalized treatment, but it remains an unmet\\nneed.3 Several MRI measures have been investigated, and they have\\nbeen proven to be useful prognostic markers, especially in the earliest\\nphases of the disease.3,4 In particular, long-term longitudinal studies\\nhave demonstrated that MRI measures of T2-hyperintense lesions\\n(number, location, and volume) in patients with clinically isolated syn-\\ndrome (CIS) help to predict conversion to definite MS.5 The number\\nand location of T2 lesions in CIS patients have also been associated\\nwith disability accumulation, as measured using the Expanded Disabil-\\nity Status Scale (EDSS),5,6 and evolution to secondary progressive (SP)\\nMS.6,7 However, conventional MRI measures, such as T2-hyperintense\\nlesion volume, typically show only mild to moderate correlations with\\nmeasures of disability in patients with established MS.8 Studies evalu-\\nating whole brain and gray matter (GM) volumes have demonstrated\\nrelevant associations between atrophy and long-term disability worsen-\\ning and cognitive impairment.9,10 Of note, differently from the early\\nphases of the disease where MRI has reliably demonstrated to be prom-\\nising for prognostication, studies that aimed to identify prognostic MRI\\nmarkers in patients with definite MS gave inconsistent results.3 As a\\nconsequence, no reliable marker to predict medium- and long-term dis-\\nease evolution is currently available in these patients.11\\nArtificial intelligence and, in particular, deep learning approaches\\nhave rapidly become popular mathematical models to be applied on MRI\\ndata, to make predictions or decisionswithout the need to identify a priori\\nthe critical features that will be used in the model.12–15 In the field of MS,\\ndeep learning approaches have been mainly applied for tasks related\\nto the improvement of white matter (WM) lesions detection16–19 and\\nsegmentation,20 brain tissue segmentation,21 and, only recently, for\\nReceived for publication October 11, 2021; and accepted for publication, after revi-\\nsion, November 18, 2021.\\nFrom the *Neuroimaging Research Unit, Division of Neuroscience, and†Neurology\\nUnit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute;‡Vita-Salute San Raffaele University,\\nMilan; §Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, and 3T MRI Cen-\\nter, University of Campania“Luigi Vanvitelli,” Naples; ||Department of Medicine,\\nSurgery, and Neuroscience, University of Siena, Siena; ¶Department of Human Neu-\\nrosciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome; #IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli; and\\n**Neurorehabilitation Unit and††Neurophysiology Service, IRCCS San Raffaele\\nScientific Institute, Milan, Italy.\\nConflicts of interest and sources of funding: L.S. declared the receipt of grants\\n(FISM2019/BR/009) and contracts from FISM (Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi\\nMultipla) within a fellowship program.

To perform well, deep learning al-\\ngorithms need large cohorts of MS patients including the major clin-\\nical phenotypes to accurately model the disease course and obtain ro-\\nbust and reliable results. The Italian Neuroimaging Network Initiative\\n(INNI) promotes the construction and maintenance of a repository\\nwhere MRI, clinical, and neuropsychological data from MS patients\\nand healthy controls are collected from 4 Italian research centers with\\ninternationally recognized expertise in the MS field, with the main\\ngoal of improving the application of MRI to study MS and to define\\nnovel MRI biomarkers for monitoring disease course.24\\nThe aim of this study was to develop and apply a deep learning\\nalgorithm on a large multicenter cohort of patients collected from INNI\\nto predict disease worsening in MS patients from their baseline MRI\\nfeatures. Toward this goal, MS patients with a baseline MRI scan and\\na clinical and cognitive follow-up of at least 2 years were considered.\\nThe performance of the algorithm was then evaluated on an indepen-\\ndent test set and compared with that of 2 expert physicians.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nEthics Committee Approval\\nApproval was received from the local ethical standards commit-\\ntee of each participating center, and written informed consent was ob-\\ntained from all participants at the time of data acquisition.\\nSubjects\\nData from 373 MS patients,25 299 with relapsing-remitting (RR)\\nMS and 74 with progressive (P) MS, with a clinical follow-up of 2 years\\n(±0.5 years) were retrieved from the INNI online repository (https://\\ndatabase.inni-ms.org) from 4 centers identified as“A,”“ B,”“ C,” and\\n“D.” At the time of writing this article, INNI repository comprised\\nMRI, demographic, and clinical data from 1519 MS patients with the\\nmain clinical phenotypes and 828 healthy volunteers for a total of\\n2347 subjects and 4351 MRI examinations acquired at the 4 Italian pro-\\nmoting centers. The patients' baseline visits collected for this study were\\nacquired from year 2007 to 2020.\\nAll participants underwent a clinical and MRI assessment at\\nbaseline with rating of the EDSS score and cognitive impairment with\\nthe Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), assessed within 48 hours\\nfrom the baseline MRI acquisition. At follow-up (mean follow-up time,\\n2 ± 0.5 years), all patients underwent a clinical assessment with rating\\nof the EDSS, and a subgroup of 151 MS patients also had an evaluation\\nof the SDMT.\\nMRI Acquisitions\\nUsing 3.0 T scanners (centers A and D: Intera [or Ingenia] and\\nAchieva, respectively; Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands;\\ncenter B: Signa HDxt; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI; center C:\\nMagnetom Verio; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), the following images\\nwere retrieved from the INNI database for the purposes of this study:\\n(1) 2D or 3D T2-weighted scans acquired with axial (or sagittal) orienta-\\ntion and a slice thickness of 3 or 1 mm, pixel size of 1/C2 1 mm, repetition\\ntime ranging from 2500 to 5310 milliseconds, echo time from 80 to\\n330 milliseconds, flip angle of 90 or 150 degrees, and echo train length\\nfrom 4 to 128; (2) 3D T1-weighted scans (fast field echo, turbo field\\necho, inversion recovery fast spoiled gradient echo, or magnetization pre-\\npared rapid gradient echo) with axial or sagittal orientation and isotropic\\npixel size of 1/C2 1 /C2 1 mm; repetition time ranging from 6.988 to 25 mil-\\nliseconds and 1900 milliseconds; echo time from 2.85 to 4.6 milliseconds;\\ninversion time ranging from 650 (for inversion recovery fast spoiled gra-\\ndient echo sequences) to 1000 milliseconds (for fast field echo and mag-\\nnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequences); and flip angle of 8, 9,\\nor 30 degrees. From center A, we retrieved MRI data acquired from 2 dif-\\nferent 3.0 T scanners (Intera and Ingenia; Philips Medical Systems, Best,\\nthe Netherlands) with 2 different MRI protocols26; thus we identify them\\nas center A1 and A2.\\nImage Preprocessing\\nStandardized preprocessing is systematically performed on all\\nINNI MRI data, including a procedure for quality control. Several mea-\\nsures to guarantee the quality of data uploaded to the INNI repository\\nfor multicenter MS studies were already implemented and described\\nin a previous study.26 Moreover, all sagittal acquisitions were reoriented\\nto the axial plane, and for the 3D T1-weighted acquisitions, excessive\\nportions of the neck were removed. Three-dimensional T1-weighted\\nand T2-weighted sequences were aligned to a common space using lin-\\near brain image registration (FMRIB's Linear Image Registration\\nTool),27 and brain tissues were separated from nonbrain tissues on both\\nscans (Brain Extraction Tool).28 During this affine registration, the skull\\nimage is used to determine a volumetric scaling factor to normalize\\nbrain tissue volumes accounting for different head sizes.29 Normalized\\nbrain volume (NBV), normalized GM volume (NGMV), and normalized\\nWM volume (NWMV) were then measured from the 3D T1-weighted\\nimages using the FSL SIENAx software.30 Focal T2-hyperintense WM\\nlesions were manually identified and segmented by raters from each par-\\nticipating center with a relevant expertise in the identification of MS WM\\nlesions (at least 10 years of experience for each rater in each center).\\nThen, all the T2-hyperintense WM lesion masks were visually inspected\\nand edited, if necessary, by experts from the center A. As also reported\\nin a previous article describing the quality control procedures,26 this\\n2-step process allowed us to obtain accurate and reproducible WM le-\\nsion masks. Focal T2-hyperintense WM lesions were identified and\\nsegmented following the recently published recommendations.31\\nFor the purposes of this study, axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted\\nimages from each patient were registered to the MNI-152 atlas space32\\nusing just an affine transformation (FMRIB's Linear Image Registration\\nTool, FSL toolbox, version 5.0.5) to obtain comparable anatomical loca-\\ntions among patients while preserving their brain topology. Coregistered\\nT1-weighted and T2-weighted images in MNI space were the input for\\nthe implemented deep learning algorithm.\\nTraining and Testing Dataset\\nThe whole data set was separated into a training set and a test set,\\nas schematically shown in Figure 1. In the training set, 325 MS patients\\nacquired from centers A1, B, C, and D were included. The training set\\nwas used to adjust the weights of the model and to measure the perfor-\\nmance of the trained convolutional neural network (CNN) (the validation\\nstep) after each epoch. The test set consisted of 48 MS patients acquired\\nat center A2 and was selected to constitute an independent data set for\\nmodel evaluation, because MRIs for these patients were acquired on a\\ndifferent MR scanner in respect to the MRIs used for the training phase.\\nTo train the algorithm, a binary vector with the information on\\ndisease evolution for each patient was created (0 = stable patient;\\n1 = worsened patient). We classified patients as follows:\\n\\x81 Clinically worsened if their EDSS score increase at follow-up was\\n≥1.5 when baseline EDSS was 0,≥1.0 when EDSS at baseline was\\n<6.0, and≥0.5 when EDSS at baseline was≥6.0; and\\n\\x81 Cognitively worsened when there was an SDMT raw score change of\\nat least 4 points at follow-up.33\\nUsing these binary classifications, we trained and tested 3 differ-\\nent models according to clinical worsening (EDSS-based model), cog-\\nnitive worsening (SDMT -based model), or both (EDSS + SDMT–\\nbased model).\\nStorelli et al Investigative Radiology \\x81 Volume 57, Number 7, July 2022\\n424 www.investigativeradiology.com © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The\\nalgorithm was developed starting from a CNN architecture already im-\\nplemented in our previous study to perform classification among differ-\\nent WM diseases that can enter differential diagnosis with MS.22 We\\nmodified the network specifically for this study, reducing the number\\nof CNN blocks and hyperparameters of the model to be optimized.\\nMoreover, we did not use data augmentation, because the size of the\\ntraining sample was considered adequate.34 The inputs to the models\\nwere the intensity normalized T2-weighted and T1-weighted entire im-\\nages for each patient and a true class binary vector with the information\\non disease evolution (0 = stable; 1 = worsened) at 2 years. The output of\\nthe algorithm was a probability value for each patient of belonging to 1\\nof the 2 classes: MS stable or MS worsening. A schematic overview of\\nthe deep learning algorithm implemented is shown in Figure 2.\\nThe network architecture comprises a sequence of three 3D\\nconvolutional blocks with increasing number of filters (32, 64, and\\n128) and the same filter size of 3/C2 3 /C2 3 for each MR sequence\\n(T2-weighted and T1-weighted images), followed by a fully connected\\nlayer and a rectified linear unit activation function. This function forces\\nto zero any negative input value maintaining the nonlinearity of the\\nmodel, and is commonly used because it leads to efficient training on\\nlarge data sets. A max-pooling layer tailed a response normalization\\nfunction to reduce the dimensionality of the input representation and,\\nas a consequence, the computational cost. The final layer for each\\nblock consisted of a dropout function (dropout fraction = 0.2) as an ad-\\nditional regularization method to reduce overfitting and improve gen-\\neralizability. The previously described block is repeated 3 times for\\neach MR sequence, and their final outputs are then merged to take ad-\\nvantage from both image contrasts (T2-weighted and T1-weighted).\\nLastly, a fully connected dense layer was incorporated to associate ev-\\nery input to every output of each layer by a weight estimated with a lin-\\near activation function. On the basis of the previously obtained fea-\\ntures, the last layer performs the classification and outputs a scalar\\nprobability value, for each patient, of belonging to each of the classifi-\\ncation labels the model is trying to predict (stable or worsened).\\nGiven the fact that in our data set there was a class imbalance\\n(more stable than worsened MS patients), during the training phase,\\nwe introduced a“class-weight” in the error estimation to give a higher\\nweight to the underrepresented class. This parameter was set according\\nto the ratio between the number of patients in the stable and worsened\\ngroups. The model was trained for 150 epochs with the early stopping\\noption. To optimize feature representation throughout the training pro-\\ncess, we select a batch size of 32 and the learning rate was set to 0.001.\\nThe method was implemented in the Python programming lan-\\nguage (Release 2.7.15), using the Keras module for neural networks\\nwith Theano as a back end and a Tesla K40 GPU.\\nThe algorithm was trained to classify (1) clinical evolution\\n(based on EDSS change), and, for a subgroup of 151 MS patients, also\\n(2) cognitive evolution (based on SDMT score change) or (3) both.\\nFIGURE 1.Outline of the collected data set and how it was split into training and test sets for the optimization, validation, and test phases of the model.\\nThe sample size for each center is also reported.\\nInvestigative Radiology \\x81 Volume 57, Number 7, July 2022 Deep Learning in Multiple Sclerosis Prognosis\\n© 2022 W olters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Moreover, they worked on the predic-\\ntion of the exact EDSS score and not the“binary prognosis” (stable or\\nworsened) as in our proposed algorithm.42\\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a\\ndeep learning model on a multicenter cohort of MS patients to predict\\ndisease evolution at 2 years from baseline MRI scans. We also tested\\nits performance to predict clinical and/or cognitive worsening on an in-\\ndependent data set in comparison to physicians' expertise. We obtained\\ngood accuracy (80%) on the validation set for prognosis of clinical dis-\\nability (EDSS-based model) that increased (to 87%) when adding cog-\\nnitive information to train the algorithm. However, when using the cog-\\nnitive information alone during the training (SDMT -based model), we\\nobtained a lower accuracy of 71% in predicting cognitive worsening.\\nThis may be partly due to the lower sample size used when training\\nthe SDMT -based model compared with the EDSS-based model (only\\n151 of the 373 selected patients had a cognitive assessment after\\n2 years), thus leading to a less optimal network. In addition, we cannot\\nexclude that the analysis of other image contrasts, not included in our\\nstudy, such as double inversion recovery sequences, would have re-\\nsulted in better performance for the SDMT -based model, because sev-\\neral studies have found a correlation between cognitive deficits and\\nthe presence or volume of cortical lesions.46\\nConsidering the independent test set, the 3 prognostic models\\n(EDSS-based, SDMT -based, and EDSS + SDMT–based) confirmed\\nthe high accuracies, similar to those found for the validation set, and\\nthe same differences among them. Thus, the model proved to be robust\\nand generalizable enough to be used on other, previously unseen, MRI\\ndata sets. Moreover, for all models, the specificity was higher than the\\nsensitivity in the prognosis of clinical and cognitive worsening of these\\npatients. Multiple sclerosis patients with a negative prognosis (clinical\\nand/or cognitive worsening) were less often identified (57.1% to 75%\\nof disease worsened patients) by the proposed algorithm compared with\\nstable patients (82% to 90% of stable patients were correctly identified).\\nThis could be most probably due to the class imbalance between stable\\nand worsened MS patients in the input data set. However, it is important\\nto note that expert raters also showed poorer performance in identifying\\nclinically and/or cognitively worsened patients in comparison to stable\\nones. Multiple sclerosis is a very heterogeneous disease with different\\nclinical manifestations among patients and with unpredictable course\\nand evolution.1,47 Based on available prognostic data, it is likely that\\nthe inclusion of clinical information at baseline (other than EDSS)\\nwould have allowed a more comprehensive evaluation of disease prog-\\nnosis, at least for the expert raters. However, in this case, increasing in-\\nput variables would be required by the deep learning network with\\nlower versatility in practical use and higher computational cost. More\\ninput features often make a predictive artificial intelligence task more\\nchallenging to model and can have a negative impact on its fitting per-\\nformance.48 Another important aspect that should be considered, partic-\\nularly when addressing disability worsening, is the involvement of the\\nspinal cord, by examining both lesions and atrophy.3,49,50\\nOverall, disease prognosis assessed by human raters showed a\\ngood accuracy for both the training and test data sets (68% and 70%,\\nrespectively). Given the criteria on which visual assessment by the ex-\\npert raters was performed, these findings confirmed the prognostic\\nvalue of relatively simple MRI features, such as the number and loca-\\ntion of T2-hyperintense WM lesions and gross atrophy, as already dem-\\nonstrated by previous studies.4,9,10,50 In Figures 4 and 5, it is noticeable\\nhow some of these MRI markers at baseline (eg, infratentorial lesions,\\nbrain atrophy, etc) may also have been extracted by the deep learning\\nmodel as important features in its final decision on disease prognosis,\\nleading to correct or wrong classifications. For this reason, we applied\\nthe LRP method to perform at least a visual assessment of the salient\\nvoxels involved in the classification decisions of the CNN model. By\\na qualitative assessment, we found that WM lesions and periventricular\\nregions were highly relevant for the final classification of the algorithm,\\nconfirming the presence of brain atrophy and the lesion location as im-\\nportant MRI markers at baseline. However, the proposed artificial intelli-\\ngence model showed higher performance in comparison to the qualitative\\nprognostic evaluation made by the expert raters (higher accuracy, speci-\\nficity, and sensitivity). Indeed, deep learning algorithms may be able to\\nautomatically identify additional features or patterns characterizing the\\ndisease prognosis that are not visible by the expert radiologists or that\\nare still unknown. Therefore, there is still considerable ongoing research\\ninto this, because heatmap methods are limited. For example, heatmaps\\njust evidence voxels that contributed to the classification decision, but\\nthey do not offer an interpretation on the underlying reasons. Moreover,\\nthey strongly depend on the type of the network and should be read as an\\nindication on the locations that the specific classifiers emphasize.\\nThis study has some additional limitations that should be taken\\ninto account when interpreting our findings and when planning future\\nadvances. First, the model was trained to perform prognosis on the basis\\nof 2 brain MRI contrasts. However, as previously mentioned, the spinal\\ncord is an eloquent region for MS prognosis. Thus, the inclusion in the\\nmodel of spinal cord MR scans may well improve its performance, al-\\nthough high accuracy was achieved just using brain MRI data. More-\\nover, the inclusion of relevant demographic and clinical information\\nin the input features should be considered in future developments. Nev-\\nertheless, this study demonstrated that artificial intelligence techniques\\ncan reach high levels of accuracy in the prediction of disease evolution\\neven when using only MRI features to train the model. In our analyses,\\nwe did not apply any correction to compensate for the learning effect of\\nthe repeated SDMTs. However, in our study, SDMTevaluation was per-\\nformed for 151 MS patients at baseline visit as well as at the follow-up\\nvisit after 2 years. Because the follow-up time is longer than that consid-\\nered in previous studies that assessed test-retest reliability of SDMT,51\\nwe considered 2 years as an adequate interval to obtain negligible learn-\\ning effects on this test. Finally, given the small sample of patients that\\nshowed a worsening of both the EDSS and SDMT scores at follow-up\\n(2 patients of 48), a future validation on a larger cohort of patients with\\nthese clinical and cognitive impairments should be performed. How-\\never, good results were obtained even for the 2 models trained using\\nonly EDSS or SDMT information at baseline.\\nIn conclusion, we obtained a robust and accurate model for\\npredicting clinical and cognitive worsening of MS at 2 years, based\\non T1-weighted and T2-weighted brain MRI at baseline. This algorithm\\nhas the potential to be an important tool for supporting, rather than re-\\nplacing, physicians in their clinical routine for the prompt management\\nof MS patients at risk of disease worsening. Artificial intelligence could\\nbe an aid to clinicians in the difficult task of handling large amounts of\\ndata and understanding it (ie, extracting important features and pat-\\nterns), whereas conversely, the knowledge and expertise of clinicians\\nwould improve artificial intelligence performance. In the future, the\\ncapabilities of radiologists may be improved and broadened by\\nthese tools.\\nREFERENCES\\n1. Filippi M, Bar-Or A, Piehl F, et al.

We discuss its shortcomings and appraise the challenges of implementing\\nit in clinical settings, experimental trials, and research. The current deﬁnition of PIRA assumes\\nthat acute inﬂammation, which can manifest as a relapse, and neurodegeneration, manifesting as\\nprogressive disability accrual, can be disentangled by introducing speciﬁc time windows be-\\ntween the onset of relapses and the observed increase in disability. The term PIRMA (pro-\\ngression independent of relapse and MRI activity) was recently introduced to indicate disability\\naccrual in the absence of both clinical relapses and new brain and spinal cord MRI lesions.\\nAssessing PIRMA in clinical practice is highly challenging because it necessitates frequent\\nclinical assessments and brain and spinal cord MRI scans. PIRA is commonly assessed using\\nExpanded Disability Status Scale, a scale heavily weighted toward motor disability, whereas a\\nmore granular assessment of disability deterioration, including cognitive decline, using com-\\nposite measures or other tools, such as digital tools, would possess greater utility. Similarly,\\nusing PIRA as an outcome measure in randomized clinical trials is also challenging and requires\\nmethodological considerations. The underpinning pathobiology of disability accumulation,\\nthat is not associated with relapses, may encompass chronic active lesions (slowly expanding\\nlesions and paramagnetic rim lesions), cortical lesions, brain and spinal cord atrophy, partic-\\nularly in the gray matter, diﬀuse and focal microglial activation, persistent leptomeningeal\\nenhancement, and white matter tract damage. We propose to use PIRA to understand the main\\ndeterminant of disability accrual in observational, cohort studies, where regular MRI scans are\\nnot included, and introduce the term of“advanced-PIRMA”to investigate the contributions to\\ndisability accrual of the abovementioned processes, using conventional and advanced imaging.\\nThis is supported by the knowledge that MRI reﬂects the MS pathogenic mechanisms better\\nthan purely clinical descriptors. Any residual disability accrual, which remains unexplained after\\nconsidering all these mechanisms with imaging, will highlight future research priorities to help\\ncomplete our understanding of MS pathogenesis.\\nFrom the Queen Square MS Centre (O.C., F.B., A.E., A.T.T.), Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University\\nCollege London; National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) (O.C.), University College London Hospitals (UCLH) Biomedical Research Centre; Centre for Medical Image\\nComputing (F.B.), University College London, United Kingdom; Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine (F.B.), Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Neth-\\nerlands; Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences (M.C.), University of Verona; Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience (N.D.S.), University of\\nSiena; Neuroimaging Research Unit (M.F., M.A.R.), Division of Neuroscience, and Neurology Unit (M.F., M.A.R.), Neurorehabilitation Unit, Neurophysiology Service, IRCCS San\\nRaffaele Scientific Institute; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University (M.F., M.A.R.), Milan; Department of Neuroscience (C.

PIRA brings the concept of disability\\naccrual independent of relapses, considered to be exclusive to\\npatients with progressive MS,3 to the RRMS phenotype, even\\nin early MS4 and after theﬁrst demyelinating event.5 PIRA\\nappears to be the main driver of disability accumulation across\\nall MS phenotypes.1,6-8 We estimate that the proportion of\\npatients developing PIRA is 3%–4% per each year of follow-up\\n(Figure 1). The underlying mechanisms of PIRA are thought to\\nbe chronic inﬂammation and neurodegeneration, more pro-\\nnounced in progressive MS, but also present in relapsing MS.9\\nHerein, we discuss the challenges facing PIRA, from its clinical-\\nbased deﬁnition to its translation into clinical settings and trials,\\nand the likely biological underpinning PIRA, as assessed by\\nimaging. In response to calls to classify MS rooted in its\\nbiological mechanisms,10 we propose to evolve from a clinical-\\nbased deﬁnition of PIRA toward a comprehensive quantiﬁca-\\ntion of pathogenic mechanisms related to PIRA using MRI and\\nother paraclinical measures of underlying pathology. This\\ncommentary arises from the themes discussed at a Magnetic\\nResonance Imaging in MS (MAGNIMS) consortium work-\\nshop dedicated to PIRA, held in May 2023 in Verona, Italy.\\nShortcomings of PIRA Deﬁnition in\\nLight of MS Pathogenic Mechanisms\\nThe most recent, harmonized deﬁnition of PIRA8 recom-\\nmends the following principles for its assessment: (1) an in-\\ncreased disability score (or event score), commonly measured\\non the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), should be\\nrecorded at least 3 months after and 1 month before the onset\\nof an investigator-reported relapse; (2) a new baseline score\\nshould take place after each relapse; and (3) a conﬁrmation\\nscore should be assessed at least 3 months after the initial\\ndisability increase and 1 month before the onset of an\\ninvestigator-reported relapse (Figure 2).8\\nFigure 1Annual Frequency of PIRA Events Reported by Previous Studies\\nThis figure represents the percentage of people with MS who develop at least 1 PIRA event a year, as reported by previous studies.

The pathologic correlates\\nof relapses are acute inﬂammatory demyelinating lesions.9\\nBoth Wallerian degeneration of axons following transection in\\nacute lesions, and subsequent loss of chronically demyelinated\\naxons, contribute to postlesional neurodegeneration.11 In-\\nﬂammatory lesions and neurodegeneration are present at all\\nstages of MS.9 Although substrates for “primary” neuro-\\ndegeneration have been proposed,12 there is no robust evi-\\ndence for them. Longitudinal MRI studies have shown\\nongoing and sustained optic nerve atrophy 1 year after optic\\nneuritis, despite improved visual function. 13 Optical co-\\nherence tomography (OCT) has shown thinning of the ret-\\ninal ﬁber layer up to 6 months from acute optic neuritis.14\\nSimilarly, spinal cord atrophy occurs over 6 months after\\nacute myelitis, concurrent with clinical recovery.15 A sequence\\nof events, unfolding over at least 2 years, arising from white\\nmatter lesions to subsequent white matter damage and then\\ngray matter atrophy, has been demonstrated in progressive\\nMS using MRI.16 Therefore, it is credible that, at least in some\\ncases, the observed progression designated as PIRA could still\\nbe secondary to the preceding relapse, even when measured\\nlater than 3 months from relapse onset.\\nSecond, an interval of 1 month before a relapse may not be\\nappropriate to identify progression independent of that relapse.\\nMicrostructural MRI changes in the white matter of patients\\nwith MS are observed 3–18 months before acute lesions be-\\ncome visible on conventional MRI.17,18 These ﬁndings suggest\\nthat there may be inﬂammation-related neuronal damage, with\\nconsequent neurodegeneration, months before the clinical\\nonset of a subsequent relapse. Therefore, the time window\\nproposed for the deﬁnition of PIRA should be interpreted with\\ncaution.\\nThird, the development of asymptomatic brain MS lesions\\nconﬁrms that focal inﬂammatory demyelination does not al-\\nways manifest with an acute relapse. Although asymptomatic\\nspinal cord lesions are rarer than asymptomatic brain lesions,\\nthey are seen in relapsing MS.19,20 All subjects with a radio-\\nlogically isolated syndrome (RIS) who developed primary\\nprogressive MS during a 15-year follow-up possessed spinal\\ncord lesions at the time of the diagnosis of RIS,21 suggesting\\nthat disability accrual may be induced by concurrent,\\nasymptomatic inﬂammation, that may not be captured by the\\ncurrent deﬁnition of PIRA.8\\nTherefore, on current evidence, it is diﬃcult to justify a dis-\\nconnect between inﬂammatory demyelination (relapses) and\\nneurodegeneration (progression). It is possible that some\\nvariance in the observed disability accrual that deﬁnes PIRA\\ncould be linked to the preceding, concurrent, or impending\\ninﬂammation.\\nThe Limitations of Incorporating MRI\\nActivity Into PIRA\\nThe terms “true PIRA,”“ pure PIRA,” and “PIRMA” (pro-\\ngression independent of relapses and MRI activity) have been\\nproposed to add the absence of brain and spinal cord MRI\\nactivity (new T2 lesions and/or gadolinium [Gd] lesions)\\nbetween 3 months after and 1 month before the onset of a\\nrelapse.4,8 In a mildly aﬀected cohort of patients with MS,\\n30.8% of PIRA events were accompanied by MRI activity.22\\nThe inclusion of new brain T2 lesions and/or Gd lesions into\\nPIRA has reduced the number of PIRA events by half (from\\n47.9% to 23.4%),4 suggesting that asymptomatic brain lesions\\nmay be responsible for at least some PIRA events previously\\nreported. The use of PIRMA is an important step because it\\naligns the concept of PIRA to the deﬁnition of disease activity\\nin terms of both relapses and new brain lesions, commonly\\nadopted in clinical practice and MS research. It also aligns\\nPIRA to no evidence of disease activity, which also incorpo-\\nrates relapses and MRI activity.\\nHowever, the inclusion of new brain lesions into the PIRA\\ndeﬁnition (i.e., PIRMA) also requires deliberation. First,\\nasymptomatic spinal cord lesions occur between 15% and\\n25% of patients with RRMS without relapses,19,20 hence a\\nFigure 2Schematic Representation of PIRA\\nPIRA is the increase in disability of the event score\\n(most commonly EDSS) compared with baseline score.\\nAbsence of relapses is required between 90 days be-\\nfore and 30 days after the event score and at the time\\nof the confirmation score.

Importantly, lesion location may also be crucial, if\\naﬀecting an eloquent pathway. A single, cord lesion (or >1\\nlesion), critically situated in the corticospinal tract, may result\\nin asymmetric motor progression in MS with otherwise low\\nlesion burden (<5 lesions).23 This suggests that certain CNS\\nregions, such as cord, may be more relevant for progression in\\nMS than other regions or global injury. However, spinal cord\\nMRI is currently not mandatory for the monitoring of MS24\\nand technically challenging for the robust identiﬁcation of\\nlesions.\\nSecond, the occurrence of new brain lesions on conventional\\nMRI is only one of the inﬂammatory processes that may\\ncontribute to disability accrual in MS; other processes include\\nnot only asymptomatic spinal cord lesions19 but also chronic\\nactive lesions (e.g., paramagnetic rim lesions and slowly\\nexpanding lesions25) and cortical lesions26 (although these\\nappear less inﬂammatory than white matter lesions).\\nThird, a clinical relapse is the manifestation of a symptomatic\\nacute lesion, but an asymptomatic new MRI lesion could\\ntheoretically produce subclinical worsening, thereby leading\\nus to reconsider the concept of RAW because subclinical\\ndisability deterioration after an asymptomatic lesion may be\\nrelated to that new lesion. This would lead us to reconsider\\nwhat is meant by the term“relapse” and whether asymp-\\ntomatic lesions should be included under this term.27 The\\ndiﬀerences between RAW and PIRA may be simply due to the\\nintensity of the inﬂammatory process.\\nThe Challenges of Translating PIRA\\nInto Clinical Settings\\nThe use of PIRA remains limited to clinical trials and research\\n(including prospective, longitudinal cohorts) because the de-\\ntermination of PIRA in clinical practice is prohibitively chal-\\nlenging and necessitates regularly scheduled and standardized\\nclinical assessments and comprehensive MRI protocols. Several\\nparameters aﬀect the accuracy characteristics of PIRA.8 Robust\\nPIRA assessment requires a frequent number of visits, more\\nthan standard clinical care. A conﬁrmation score should be\\nrecorded at least 3 months after the event score, but preferably\\n6o r1 2m o n t h s .8 Relapses should be investigator-reported,\\nrather than patient-reported.8 Acute symptoms, which are not\\ncommonly recognized as relapses, such as predominant cog-\\nnitive impairment28 and fatigue, can occur, and disability ac-\\ncrual may be linked to these unconventional MS relapses. In\\naddition, the inclusion of all investigator-reported relapses\\n(instead of only EDSS-conﬁrmed or protocol-deﬁned relapses)\\nmay lead to fewer PIRA events. In addition, the duration of\\nfollow-up aﬀects the number of recorded PIRA events.\\nThere is an aspiration to broaden the deﬁnition of PIRA by\\nusing a composite outcome and include other clinical mani-\\nfestations of disability progression, such as cognitive decline,\\nupper and lower limb function and/or deterioration detected\\nby digital tools, and patient-reported outcome measures.\\nThese composites will likely increase the sensitivity of PIRA,\\nby encompassing patients who develop progression in do-\\nmains beyond EDSS, which is highly weighted toward motor\\ndisability, but they are likely to further limit its use in everyday\\npractice.\\nThe Limitations of PIRA as the End\\nPoint of Clinical Trials\\nSeveral studies have investigated the impact of disease-\\nmodifying treatments on PIRA as an outcome.6,29 These tri-\\nals showed that treatment beneﬁt was mostly explained by a\\nreduction in relapse activity and, consequently, RAW, and by\\nreducing development of new MRI lesions, which, in turn, may\\nlower the likelihood of PIRA in the long term. However, in the\\nshort-term, treatment trials would not signiﬁcantly slow down\\ndisability progression, possibly due to the eﬀects of existing\\nlesions, and PIRA should continue to be observed despite\\na reduction in relapse rate. A possible interpretation of this\\nﬁnding is that a treatment suppressing relapse activity, also\\nreduces disability associated with relapses, thereby making it\\nmore likely that any observed disability accrual is independent\\nof relapses.1 This hypothesis has been conﬁrmed by a recent\\nsimulation of a randomized controlled trial (personal com-\\nmunication at ECTRIMS 2023) showing that the placebo arm\\nhas fewer PIRA events than the treatment arm because it is\\nmore likely that EDSS increases are associated with relapses\\nthat are more numerous in the placebo arm than in the treat-\\nment arm. Therefore, a treatment with high eﬃcacy on relapses\\nmay artiﬁcially increase the number of PIRA events compared\\nwith placebo,29 and accurate detection of all RAW events, made\\npossible with appropriate visit timings, is necessary if PIRA is to\\nbe used as a primary end point.\\nA methodological challenge for PIRA assessment in clinical\\ntrials is that baseline EDSS at study entry is likely to reduce over\\ntime because of (1) regression to the mean and (2) patients\\nwho are enrolled after an acute event may improve over time. A\\nroving baseline, which has been recommended,8 cannot be\\nused in randomized clinical trials because a postrandomization\\nevent cannot be used as reference value because of possible\\ntreatment inﬂuence. This consideration suggests that assessing\\ntreatment eﬀects on PIRA in randomized clinical trials remains\\nchallenging, although not impossible with careful planning and\\nadapted statistical methodology.\\nAdvanced-PIRMA to Understand\\nDisability Accrual in\\nMultiple Sclerosis\\nThe mechanisms of disability accrual not associated with\\nrelapses in RRMS and captured by advanced MRI\\nNeurology | Volume 103, Number 1 | July 9, 2024 Neurology.org/N\\ne209444(4)\\nDownloaded from https://www.neurology.org by Universit degli Studi di Bologna on 21 August 2024\\n'),\n",

In addition, genetic\\nvariants (a genetic determinant of MS severity has recently\\nbeen discovered39)a n dp r oﬁles of speciﬁc proteins, such\\nas those related to the arachidonic acid-derived lipid me-\\ndiators, 40 are associated with neurodegenerative processes\\nthat contribute to disease progression. A corollary of\\nadvanced-PIRMA is that detectable residual disability ac-\\ncrual, unexplained after considering all these underlying\\nmechanisms, could highlight crucial unmet areas of future\\nresearch in MS pathobiology.\\nConclusion and Future Directions\\nPIRA has been informative in alerting clinicians to the notion\\nthat progressive disability accrual occurs across the full spec-\\ntrum of MS, similar to previous MRIﬁndings of development\\nof brain atrophy in the early stages of MS. However, the\\ninterpretation of PIRA as a measure speciﬁc to disease pro-\\ngression independent of inﬂammation cannot fully represent\\nthe underlying mechanisms of the disease.\\nThe inclusion of new brain lesions in the PIRA framework\\n(i.e., PIRMA) is an important step that aligns it with other\\nclinical end points but does not address certain fundamental\\nshortcomings: (1) disability worsening may continue for\\nmore than 3 months after a relapse and (2) inﬂammatory\\nprocesses other than brain T2/Gd lesions (i.e., asymptomatic\\nspinal cord lesions, chronic active lesions) or those not\\ndetected by MRI may contribute to the accumulation of dis-\\nability in MS.\\nA more accurate assessment of clinical deterioration,\\nbeyond EDSS (e.g., composite outcomes or digital bio-\\nmarkers), which includes cognitive decline and patient-\\nreported outcome measures, is necessary. However, this\\nwill make PIRMA assessment even more complex. More\\nconsideration should be given to the use of PIRMA as an\\nend point in clinical trials and the consequences for their\\ndesign and statistical analysis.\\nAdvanced-PIRMA can be applied to understanding the con-\\ntributions of pathogenic processes studied with imaging (e.g.,\\nnew brain and spinal cord lesions, SELs, PRLs, intracortical\\nlesions, total brain, spinal cord and gray matter atrophy, lep-\\ntomeningeal enhancement, diﬀuse microglia activation),ﬂuid\\nbiomarkers, OCT, genetic variants, and proteomics toward\\ndisability accrual. Any extant disability progression un-\\nexplained by these processes could help focus future research\\ndirections.\\nOur improved understanding of mechanisms of progression\\nand the known relationship between inﬂammation and neu-\\nrodegeneration highlight the need to move from a clinical-\\nbased deﬁnition of PIRA toward a more biologically focused\\nFigure 4 Examples of Brain Atrophy, Slowly Expanding Lesions, Spinal Cord Segmentation, Cortical Lesions, and Lep-\\ntomeningeal Enhancement\\n(A) Axial T1-weighted images acquired between 1995 (first image on the left) and 2005 (last image on the right) showing progressing development of brain\\natrophy (increase size of the ventricles and widening cortical sulci) and slowly expanding lesions (yellow arrows).

Cognitive impairment is a sometimes neglected, \\nyet common, sign and symptom with a profound effect on instrumental activities of daily living. The prevalence of \\ncognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis varies across the lifespan and might be difficult to distinguish from other \\ncauses in older age. MRI studies show that widespread changes to brain networks contribute to cognitive dysfunction, \\nand grey matter atrophy is an early sign of potential future cognitive decline. Neuropsychological research suggests \\nthat cognitive processing speed and episodic memory are the most frequently affected cognitive domains. Narrowing \\nevaluation to these core areas permits brief, routine assessment in the clinical setting. Owing to its brevity, reliability, \\nand sensitivity, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, or its computer-based analogues, can be used to monitor episodes of \\nacute disease activity. The Symbol Digit Modalities Test can also be used in clinical trials, and data increasingly show \\nthat cognitive processing speed and memory are amenable to cognitive training interventions.\\nIntroduction \\nMultiple sclerosis is an inflammatory, demyelinating \\ndisease of the CNS, with neurodegeneration being \\nmost prominent in progressive phenotypes. The course \\nof mul  tiple sclerosis varies widely. S ome patients have \\na single episode or attack, called a clinically isolated \\nsyndrome or a radiologically isolated syndrome, depend\\xad\\ning on whether the disease manifests clinically or on \\nMRI. Patients with multiple CNS lesions or neurological \\nsigns that are separated in time are diagnosed with \\nrelapsing\\xadremitting multiple sclerosis. A progressive \\ncourse refers to accumulating or worsening of neuro\\xad\\nlogical disability, inde  pendent of relapses. Cognitive  \\nimpairment can develop insidiously and progress gradu\\xad\\nally, or decline abruptly during relapses, although this \\nrapid decline has been documented only in the past \\nfew years.\\nIn this Review, we endeavour to provide a concise and \\nup\\xadto\\xaddate perspective of multiple sclerosis \\xadassociated \\ncognitive impairment. We point out that cognitive def\\xad\\nicits can arise in isolation from other neurological signs \\nand, when present, are associated with increased risk of \\nfuture neurological disability. We aim to garner apprecia\\xad\\ntion of how cognitive impairment presents throughout \\nthe life  span, posing unique challenges to the clinical \\nmanage ment of paediatric (ie, <18 years) and older \\npatients (ie, >50 years). Easily administered and sensitive \\ntests of cognitive processing speed (CPS) and memory \\nare now available to neurologists. The results of these \\ntests are associated with \\nmultiple MRI indices of cere  \\xad\\nbral disease, including chronic white matter demye\\xad\\nlination, acute inflammatory changes, and grey matter \\natrophy. These tests can be applied routinely to screen \\nfor cognitive impairment, monitor disease activity, \\nand assess the effects of treatment. Some restorative and \\ncom  pensatory interventions for cognitive rehabilita\\xad\\ntion seem to be beneficial. Additional randomised \\ncontrolled trials with cognition as the primary endpoint are needed to investigate the effects of disease\\xadmodifying \\ntherapies on cognition.\\nPrevalence, cognitive profile, and phenotypes \\nCognitive deficits can occur in the early stages of multiple \\nsclerosis, even in the absence of other neurological \\ndeficits.\\n1,2 The convention in neuropsychology is to ascribe \\ncognitive impairment to a score where performance falls \\nless than 1·5 SD below normative expectation, after accounting for demo graphics such as age and education. \\nIn diagnosing cognitive impair  ment, clinicians should \\naccount for psychiatric comorbidities, medication side \\xad\\neffects, and multiple sclerosis symptoms that might \\nadversely affect cognitive performance. In two large \\nseminal studies, patients were categorised as having cogni tive impairment if their performance was impaired \\non four of 31 tests 3 or two of 11 tests 4 in a multidomain \\nneuropsychological test battery. By these, or similar, \\nstandards for designating impairment, the prevalence of cog nitive impairment in adults with multiple sclerosis \\nranges from 34% to 65%, varying by research setting and \\ndisease course.\\n5–8\\nLike all symptoms of multiple sclerosis, cognitive \\nimpairment is characterised by high variability between \\npatients. When results are taken together for a group \\nof people with multiple sclerosis,\\n3,4 CPS, learning, and \\nmemory are most frequently involved. Deficits in executive \\nfunction and visuospatial processing are also reported, \\nbut less frequently. 3,4 In particular, in a representative \\nsample of 291 adult patients with any type of multiple \\nsclerosis,\\n4 the fre  quencies of impairments (varying by \\ntest) were as follows: 27–51% in CPS, 54–56% in visual \\nmemory, 29–34% in verbal memory, 15–28% in executive \\nfunction, and 22% in visuospatial processing. Basic \\nlanguage, semantic memory, and attention span are rarely \\nimpaired (in about 10% of patients with multiple scler\\xad\\nosis).\\n3,4 However, some studies suggest that semantic \\nfluency is more often com  promised than was previously \\nthought, especially in patients older than 50 years.9,10\\nCognitive impairment occurs in all multiple sclerosis \\nphenotypes:5,11 estimates are 20–25% of patients with \\nclinically isolated syndrome and radiologically isolated \\nsyndrome, 30–45% of patients with relapsing \\xadremitting '),\n",

Prevalence in primary \\nprogressive disease varies greatly, as this phenotype \\ncomprises less than 10% of the overall disease population \\nand study samples are small. In patients with radiologically \\nisolated syndrome, in which MRI findings sugges  tive \\nof multiple sclerosis are incidentally found in an asymp\\xad\\ntomatic individual,12 cognitive defects can pre \\xaddate the \\nappearance of other neurological symptoms and signs  \\nand are associated with CNS lesions seen on MRI. 6 In a \\nprospective study based on the Norwegian Conscript Service \\ndatabase, male participants who later developed multiple \\nsclerosis showed significantly lower intelligence quotients \\nthan did healthy controls at ages 18–19 years, several years \\nbefore their first symptoms.13 Patients with clinically iso\\xad\\nlated syndrome or relapsing \\xadremitting mul tiple sclerosis \\nshow similar neuropsychological pro files with prominent \\ninvolvement of CPS, whereas in pro  gressive forms of \\nthe disease, impaired memory and executive function are \\nmore common.5,14\\nThe so\\xadcalled benign form of multiple sclerosis merits \\ndiscussion. Patients with benign multiple sclerosis, which \\nis defined by an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) \\nscore of less than 3·0 after at least 15 years since disease \\nonset, can present with cognitive impairment despite \\npreservation of motor and other neurological functions.  \\nIn a longitudinal study, patients with benign multiple \\nsclerosis and cognitive impairment were more likely to \\nhave clinical progression on the basis of EDSS scores (ie, \\nno longer benign status) at follow \\xadup after 5 years 15 and \\n12 years16 than were patients with multiple sclerosis who \\nhad preserved cognition. These results reinforce the \\nnotion that cognitive impairment can be an early \\nmanifestation of the disease, leading to the recom\\xad\\nmendation that preserved cognitive functioning is an \\nadditional requisite for disease course type.17\\nPaediatric\\xadonset (ie, younger than 18 years at onset) \\nmultiple sclerosis  represents 2–10% of the disease popula\\xad\\ntion, and not only CPS and memory but also verbal \\nintelligence can be affected. 18 Decreased intelli  gence \\nquotient and academic skills in comparison with healthy \\ncontrols have been noted in several studies,19 suggest ing \\nthe need for neuropsychological evalua  tion, special \\neducation, or other remedial interventions (panel 1). The \\nfew longitudinal studies of cognition in people with  \\npaediatric\\xadonset multiple sclerosis have yielded incon\\xad\\nsistent results because of varying study lengths, time \\nbetween assessments, and outcome measures. Some \\nstudies have shown little change in cogni  tion,20 whereas \\nother studies have shown that up to 56% of tested patients \\ndeclined on a general cognitive composite score.21 In \\na 1 \\xadyear Canadian study of 28 patients, 22 relative to \\n26 age\\xadmatched healthy controls, patients with paediatric\\xad\\nonset multiple sclerosis showed reduced age \\xadexpected \\ngains. In a population \\xadbased longitudinal cohort of \\n5704 adults with multiple sclerosis in Sweden, 7 CPS \\ndeclined faster in patients with paediatric \\xadonset multiple \\nsclerosis compared with patients with adult onset. Notably, \\npatients with paediatric \\xadonset multiple sclerosis tend to \\naccrue physical disability more slowly than their counter\\xad\\nparts with adult onset, despite physical disability com\\xad\\nmencing at a younger age.23 Therefore, patients with \\npaediatric\\xadonset multiple sclerosis might have cognitive \\nproblems that are out of proportion to physical disability.\\nTaken as a whole, these results emphasise the chal\\xad\\nlenging diagnostic dilemmas and deleterious long \\xadterm \\nconsequences of early onset of multiple sclerosis. Cerebral \\ndamage during the formative years not only might deprive \\npatients of educational and vocational opportunities, \\nbut also can disrupt normal neuronal maturation and \\naccrual of cognitive reserve that might buffer the effects of \\ndemyelination and atrophy later in life.\\nAt the other end of the lifespan, clinicians can be con\\xad\\nfronted with a differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis\\xad\\nassociated cognitive impairment versus age \\xadassociated \\nPanel 1: Paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis: dissociation \\nbetween physical and cognitive impairment\\nA 15-year-old white girl, with 9 years of education, was \\ndiagnosed with multiple sclerosis at age 13 years. Symptoms \\nat onset were dysaesthesias in the territory of the right \\ntrigeminal nerve. The patient was treated with intramuscular \\ninterferon beta 1a but clinical symptoms and activity on MRI \\npersisted, so she was switched to natalizumab at age 18 years, \\nwhich resulted in complete clinical and MRI stability \\n(Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 1·5).\\n6 months after diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and during \\ntreatment with interferon beta 1a, psychiatric interview \\nshowed that the patient had low self-esteem and difficulties \\nwith social integration. School attendance varied because of \\nthe fluctuating multiple sclerosis symptoms, and school \\nperformance was poor. The patient had no physical disability \\nat this time.\\nAt first presentation with symptoms of multiple sclerosis at \\nage 13 years, neuropsychological testing showed impaired \\nprocessing speed on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, impaired \\nmemory, and impaired linguistic skills in terms of verbal \\nfluency. After 1 year on natalizumab, repeat neuropsychological \\ntesting was stable with some improvement on the Symbol \\nDigit Modalities Test.

This patient’s decreased linguistic abilities, \\nwhich are seldom seen in adult patients, were a major \\nimpediment to school progress.

The diagnosis is particularly \\nimportant because some treatments, such as acetyl\\xad\\ncholinesterase inhibitors, are indicated for people with \\nAlzheimer’s disease,24 but not for those with multiple \\nsclerosis.25 Some evidence suggests that the cognitive \\nprofile of patients with multiple sclerosis older than \\n50 years does not differ from that of the general popula\\xad\\ntion with multiple sclerosis, although Jakimovski and \\ncolleagues9 reported that patients older than 50 years \\n(mean age 62 ·1 years [SD 6·3]) had impairments on a \\nsemantic fluency test, as frequently observed in patients \\nwith Alzheimer’s disease. Neuropsychological testing that \\nincludes comprehensive language assessment and radio\\xad\\nlogical testing that is more specific to other causes \\nof cognitive impairment other than multiple sclerosis \\n(eg, amyloid PET) might be needed in evaluating older \\npatients (ie, older than 50 years) with multiple sclerosis \\n(panel 2). Vascular cognitive impairment is characterised \\nby lacunes and widespread ischaemic white matter lesions, \\naffecting CPS and executive function.26 This char acterisa\\xad\\ntion is particularly relevant considering that vascu  lar \\ncomor bidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyper\\xad\\nlipi daemia have been increasingly reported in people \\nwith multiple sclerosis.27 In sum, for older patients, the \\ndifferential diagnosis of cognitive impairment due to \\nmultiple sclerosis from that of Alzheimer’s disease, \\nvascular dementia, and related disorder requires a compre\\xad\\nhensive analysis of cognitive profile and advanced imaging.\\nMRI assessment \\nEarly MRI studies showed that the extent of white matter \\nabnormalities visible on T2 \\xadweighted MRI did not fully \\nexplain the severity of cognitive impairment in patients \\nwith multiple sclerosis.28 Subsequent attempts to visual\\xad\\nise more subtle damage, by use of more advanced MRI \\ntechniques, such as magnetisation transfer, diffu  sion \\ntensor imaging, and T1 relaxometry, indicated wide\\xad\\nspread damage to brain tissue that appeared normal on \\nconventional T1\\xadweighted or T2\\xadweighted MRI.29–32 Other \\nimprovements in MRI technology included double \\ninversion recovery, providing visualisation of cortical \\nlesions,33 which were robustly correlated with cognitive \\ndecline.34\\nOf volumetric measures, grey matter volume correlated  \\nwith cognitive performance in several studies focusing \\non the deep grey matter,35 mesial temporal cortex, 36 and \\nneocortex.37 The clinical significance of damage to deep \\ngrey matter structures was further established by studying \\natrophy38 and diffusivity changes of the thalamus,39 which \\nwere both independently correlated with cognitive impair\\xad\\nment. Besides the thalamus and the cortical grey matter, \\nhippocampal volume40 and function 41 are altered in \\npatients with multiple sclerosis, and the hippocampus is a \\npre dilection site for demyelinated lesions.42\\nIn addition to structural damage, studies have increas\\xad\\ningly focused on the functional connectivity of grey matter \\nstructures, such as the thalamus, hippocampus, and \\ncerebral cortex, by use of resting state functional MRI. \\nThese studies noted altered connectivity patterns in \\npatients with multiple sclerosis who had cognitive impair\\xad\\nment.43,44 Although the dynamics found in patients with \\nmultiple sclerosis who have cognitive impairment differ \\nfrom those of healthy controls without multiple sclerosis, \\nthe direction of the relationship is inconsistent: increased \\nfunctional connectivity is noted in some studies,45 and \\ndecreased connectivity in others. 46 Early in the disease, \\nincreased connectivity can signify that neuronal resources \\nare compensating for demyelina  tion and neuronal loss. \\nLater, once these reserve resources are exhausted, con\\xad\\nnectivity diminishes, and cognitive impairment is more \\napparent. Overall, these network functional MRI studies \\nindicate that cognitive decline is explained by an accruing \\ndestabilisation of the brain network physiology.

The white matter \\nlesions and diffuse damage, as well as the grey matter \\nlesions and atrophy, together lead to the variable symp\\xad\\ntoms of cognitive impairment in patients with multiple \\nsclerosis. Combined structural and functional imaging \\nmeasures provide an explana  tion for the observed clini\\xad\\ncal heterogeneity.47 At this point, prediction of cognitive \\ndecline in individual patients is difficult on the basis \\nof MRI alone. Of the MRI measures that have been investi\\xad\\ngated, grey matter atrophy seems to be the most reliable \\nmarker and patients with more severe structural damage \\nat baseline are at greatest risk for future cognitive impair\\xad\\nment.48 When such atrophy is readily apparent, this could \\nalert clinicians to the need for further investigation  of a \\npatient’s cognitive status, to identify people at risk for \\nemployment loss or in need of cognitive rehabilitation.\\nCognitive assessment \\nClinical neuropsychologists have abandoned lengthy, \\ncomprehensive test batteries for patients with multiple \\nsclerosis, in favour of more targeted, sensitive tests, such \\nas the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT).49 The SDMT \\npresents a symbol–digit pairing key at the top of a page \\nand a series of symbols below, each with a blank space \\nunderneath. For 90 s, the examinee orally indicates the \\nmatching number associated with a random array of \\nsymbols, as rapidly as possible. Originally administered in \\na written response format, followed by an oral response, \\nRao50 abandoned the written format to avoid the potential \\nconfounders of upper extremity weakness and ataxia. The \\noral response SDMT has since become the gold standard \\nfor assessing cognition in patients with multiple scler\\xad\\nosis.51,52 Benedict and colleagues 53 further developed the \\ntest by establishing equivalent, alternate forms to mitigate \\nthe effects of associative memory. As noted previously,51,54 \\nthe SDMT is sensitive but non \\xadspecific. The test empha\\xad\\nsises processing speed, but a patient’s performance also \\ndepends to some extent on other functions, such as \\nworking memory, paired \\xadassociate learning, and visual \\nscanning. The more complex a task, the more likely it is to \\nbe sensitive to change and cerebral pathology, and this \\nsensitivity might partly explain the importance of the \\nSDMT in clinical and research applications (for a historical \\nperspective see Benedict and colleagues).51\\nEpisodic memory tests emphasising learning over \\nsuccessive trials, followed by a measure of retention or \\ndelayed recall after 20–30 min, are a mainstay of clinical \\nneuropsychology. On the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning \\nTest (RA VLT),55 the examiner reads a list of 15 words and \\nasks the patient to recall as many words as possible. There \\nare five learning trials followed by a delayed recall task, in \\nwhich the patient recalls the same information without \\nanother exposure to the word list. Another frequently used \\nverbal memory test, the California Verbal Learning Test \\n(CVLT),56 also discriminates cognitive impairment in \\npatients with multiple sclerosis from otherwise healthy \\ncontrols. A visual memory test called the Brief Visuospatial \\nMemory Test Revised (BVMTR)57 presents a 2  × 3 matrix \\nof six figures for 10 s. Visual learning is assessed by \\nthe rendering of the figures after exposure and, as in the \\nRA VLT or CVLT, patients are asked to retain the same \\ninformation over 20–30 min. These memory tests \\n(ie, RA VLT, CVLT, and BVMTR) are nearly as effective as \\nthe SDMT at distinguishing cognitive impairment in \\npatients with multiple sclerosis from otherwise healthy \\nindividuals. In a syste  matic review, effect size for dis\\xad\\ntinguishing cognitive impairment in people with multiple \\nsclerosis from otherwise healthy controls (Cohen’s d) was \\nreported as 1·1 for SDMT, 1·0 for BVMTR, and 0·9 for \\nCVLT.51 Patients with multiple sclerosis rarely show \\nevidence of rapid forgetting on these memory tests, unlike \\npatients with Alzheimer’s disease, in whom rapid for\\xad\\ngetting of learned information is a hallmark. Rather, in \\nmul tiple sclerosis, the initial learning most clearly \\ndiscriminates patients from healthy controls. 58 Conse\\xad\\nquently, only the learning trials of the CVLT and BVMTR \\nwere recommended for routine use in mul  tiple sclerosis \\nclinics.52 Importantly, neuropsycho  logical test batteries \\nemphasising CPS and memory correlate  with employ\\xad\\nability59 and other activities of daily living.60\\nTwo consensus conference initiatives recommended  \\noptimal brief assessment batteries for multiple sclerosis: \\nthe Multiple Sclerosis Outcomes Assessment Consortium \\n(MSOAC)61 and the Brief International Cognitive \\nAssessment for Multiple Sclerosis  (BICAMS).52 The \\nFigure 1: SDMT decline and recovery curves in patients with cognitive relapse\\nChange from baseline in the difference between relapsing (defined by clinical diagnosis of gadolinium \\nenhancement on MRI) patients and stable patients in raw SDMT score.

Some of these tests yield data that are \\nsimilar whether or not a technician is present.68\\nMonitoring cognitive function in the clinical \\nsetting \\nMany patients with multiple sclerosis have progressive \\ncognitive decline due to neurodegeneration. 69 Gradual \\nslowing on CPS tests such as the SDMT 70 is related to a \\nloss of grey matter volume (eg, thalamic atrophy)71 and is \\npartly mitigated by the effects of cognitive reserve. 72,73 \\nMonitoring for progressing cognitive dysfunction is, \\ntherefore, one goal for screening in clinical settings.\\nCognitive deficits are also a sign of acute disease activity. \\nRelapses are defined as new or worsening neurological \\nsigns or symptoms lasting longer than 24 h, in the absence \\nof fever or infection.74,75 Relapses are commonly treated \\nby use of a short course of corticosteroid therapy at a \\nhigh dose, oral or intravenous methylprednisolone,76 \\nprednisone, or adrenocorticotropic hormone.77,78 Relapses \\nare typically diagnosed by sensory signs and physical \\nmanifestations via neuro  logi cal examination. Early case \\nreports and uncontrolled observational studies 79–82 sug\\xad\\ngested that acute changes in cognition could signify a \\nrelapse. However, these studies either did not control for \\ncognitive level before the relapse or did not include a \\ncomparison group to control for practice effects.\\nMorrow and colleagues 83 evaluated monthly SDMT \\nvalues used to screen for progressive multifocal leuko\\xad\\nencephalopathy in the STRATA study of patients receiving \\nnatalizumab for multiple sclerosis. The analysis showed \\na transient decline during relapses, followed by partial \\nrecov ery. However, the specific neurological deficits \\nshown by the patients who relapsed were not described, \\nand it is certainly possible that impairments that could \\naffect cogni tive performance, such as optic neuritis, severe \\nataxia, upper extremity paresis, or other signs, might have \\naffected the results. Benedict and colleagues 84 studied  \\npatients who were having a relapse and who had  symp\\xad\\ntoms and signs of cognitive impairment by self \\xadreport,  \\ninformant\\xadreport, or clinician impression. Patients with \\noptic neuritis, upper extremity paresis, severe ataxia, or \\nspinal cord signs that might compromise cognitive testing \\nwere excluded.

Preliminary work has suggested that this \\nrelationship might well exist. Brain HQ showed greater \\nbenefit on SDMT in patients with multiple sclerosis \\nwho had a high cognitive reserve, low disruption of \\nwhite matter tracts, and functional MRI profiles of con\\xad\\nnectivity that appeared closest to those of people without \\nmultiple sclerois.114\\nStrategy\\xadbased compensatory approaches emphasise \\nmanualised behavioural therapy that is administered by a \\ntherapist for individuals or groups. The modified Story \\nMemory Technique was the first compensatory approach \\nto be published, providing class I evidence for efficacy.106 \\nThe modified Story Memory Technique trains patients \\nto use context and imagery as strategies to improve \\nthe retention of information, up to 6 months post \\xad\\ntreatment.106 After 5 weeks of training, relative to placebo, \\npatients with memory impairment (n=86) recalled signi\\xad\\nficantly more words over five learning trials on the CVLT \\n(ie, a moderate to large effect), which was the primary \\nendpoint in the study. Self \\xadreported and family \\xadreported \\neveryday functioning, the secondary endpoint, also \\nshowed improvements. This treatment effect was \\nassociated with increased brain activation and functional \\nconnectivity in areas associated with learning and \\nmemory.115,116\\nExamples of other strategy \\xadbased approaches include \\nmental imagery, musical mnemonics, goal attainment \\ntraining, and general compensatory strategies (table). \\nDespite the increased degree and breadth of cognitive \\nimpairment in patients with progressive forms of mul tiple \\nsclerosis, most rehabilitation studies have focused on \\nrelapsing\\xadremitting multiple sclerosis. Studies suggest \\nthat both restorative102 and com pensatory117 approaches are \\nalso useful in treating cognitive impair ment in people with \\na progressive course, although these studies are scarce and \\nthere are exceptions.118 As patients with progressive disease \\nhave less cognitive reserve and grey matter volume, they \\nmight be less able to benefit from a restorative approach \\nthan patients with relapsing\\xadremitting multiple sclerosis. \\nThe promis ing results of cognitive retraining in patients \\nwith mul  tiple sclerosis provide an opportunity for an \\nimproved understanding of the underlying mechanisms \\nassociated with treatment response, which should be \\ninvestigated further in future research.\\nSome investigators are combining cognitive rehabi\\xad\\nlitation with other interventions to maximise effects, such \\nas cognitive behavioural therapy,118 transcranial direct cur\\xad\\nrent stimulation,119 and aerobic exercise.120 These combined  \\napproaches, although promising, require further research \\nbefore they are ready for clinical practice.\\nAs a single \\xadmodality intervention, exercise training \\nwould seem a viable approach in patients with multiple \\nscler osis, considering the cognitive benefits of aerobic \\nfitness, physical activity, and exercise in healthy older \\nadults. Motl and colleagues121 have called for randomised \\ncontrolled trials in patients with multiple sclerosis that \\nadopt the same interventions that were shown to be \\nsuccessful in the gerontology literature. Although there is \\nsome pre  liminary evidence that aerobic, resistance, \\nbalance, and other modes of exercise training might \\nimprove cognition, in multiple sclerosis, this conclusion \\nseems premature. A 2011 system atic review by Motl and  \\ncolleagues121 examined cognitive outcomes and noted \\nconflicting evidence and metho  dological concerns, such \\nas studies were not designed specifically to improve \\ncognition, inadequate statistical power, and an absence of \\ntransferability to quality of life outcomes. Notably, studies \\nthat did include cognition as a primary outcome often \\nshowed a beneficial effect on cognition, whereas those \\nthat did not include cognition as a primary outcome often \\nreported negative or no effects. A 2016 update to this \\nreview reported mostly positive findings.120 However, none \\nof the 21 new studies in the update recruited patients with \\ncognitive impairment a priori. Yet 16 of 21 (76%) studies  \\nwere randomised controlled trials, most of which used \\nneuropsychological tests as the primary outcome. Taken \\ntogether, these findings suggest that claims that exercise \\ntraining can be used to treat cognitive impairment in \\npatients with multiple sclerosis are premature.\\nFuture directions for research into exercise and cogni\\xad\\ntion should include examining the effects of interventions \\nthat might improve cognition on brain activity via neuro\\xad\\nimaging. For example, in a pilot investigation of the \\neffects of 12 weeks of supervised, progressive exercise \\ntraining for walking on a treadmill, the investigators \\nassessed verbal learning and memory in eight ambulatory \\npatients with multiple sclerosis and investigated the \\ntreatment’s effect on the hippocampus by use of advanced \\nneuro imaging (eg, mag  netic resonance elastography). 122 \\nResults showed that exercise training improved learning \\nand memory, and that this improvement was strongly \\nassociated with hippocampal activity.\\nConclusions and future directions \\nCognitive impairment is no longer regarded as a rare or \\npoorly measured sign in patients with multiple sclerosis. \\nEasily applied and sensitive tests, such as the SDMT, make \\ncognitive appraisal accessible in neurology clinics and \\nphase 3 trials. Defective CPS and impaired learning and \\nmemory are associated with the core pathological elements \\nof multiple sclerosis on MRI. Most closely tied to cognitive \\nimpair ment are regional grey matter atrophy, neural  \\nnetwork disruption, and poor reserve\\xadbased compensatory \\nmech anisms, as shown by functional MRI. Although \\nslowed processing is the hallmark of cognitive impairment \\nin all pheno types, patients with paediatric\\xadonset multiple  \\nscler osis also struggle to develop linguistic skills and \\ncognitive reserve, affecting academic performance and \\nresilience later in life (panel 1).

Therefore, although simple \\nneuro psychological tests are useful for routine care for \\npatients with multiple sclerosis, a need exists for more \\ncompre hensive assessment in these multiple sclerosis \\nsubpopulations.\\nThe course of cognitive decline needs further study. We \\nknow that cognitive impairment occurs in patients with \\nradio logically isolated syndrome, clinically isolated syn\\xad\\ndrome, or even the so \\xadcalled benign form of multiple \\nsclerosis. Clinicians should bear in mind that cognitive \\nimpairment can present in patients with multiple \\nsclerosis in the absence of other neurological signs or \\nsymptoms. Cognitive impairment is a common cause of \\nwork problems123 and job loss 124 and bodes poorly for the \\nrisk of future disability worsening. How much of this \\nimpairment reflects neuro degeneration that might occur \\nin otherwise stable patients is unknown, as is the degree \\nto which worsen  ing cognition reflects incomplete \\nrecovery from acute, demyelinating lesions. In reviewing \\nthe litera ture regard ing relapses, we have distinguished \\nbetween relapses in which cognitive manifestations are \\nin addition to other relapse signs, and in which cognition \\nis the only deficit—in both cases, patients might not \\nfully recover and would require follow\\xadup. Well designed \\nlongitudinal studies that account for the effects of \\ncognitive relapses from early in the course of the dis\\xad\\nease, with healthy demographically matched controls, are \\nsorely needed.\\nThe accessibility of neuropsychological testing has \\nincreased substantially over the past decade, as shown by \\nthe MSOAC61 and BICAMS52 initiatives. Additionally, the \\nrange of platforms is rapidly expanding for the appraisal \\nof cognition, including telemedicine125 and computer\\xad\\nised neuropsychological assessment devices. 67 Although \\nmore research is needed to establish the validity of many \\ncomputerised neuropsychological assessment devices, in \\nour opinion, the time has clearly come for CPS tests to be \\nused in clinical routine for varying purposes. As test  ing \\nbecomes more commonplace, documented cognitive \\ndeficits will be increasingly appreciated by clinicians as \\nanother clinical sign of acute or subacute disease activity. \\nAdministration of the SDMT or a similar task is recom\\xad\\nmended by consensus for baseline testing soon after \\ndiagnosis, annually, or as indicated for clinical purposes.126 \\nWe concur with this opinion. The SDMT is the neuro\\xad\\npsychological test that is most widely recommended \\nbecause of its sensitivity, reliability, and predictive validity \\nin patients with multiple sclerosis. To avoid overexposure \\nto the same test, different versions of the SDMT \\n(eg, adaptations for computerised neuro  psychological \\nassessment devices) should be used to screen for cognitive \\nrelapse, assess the effects of treat  ments, or for other \\npurposes. The SDMT is increasingly applied in phase 3 \\nclinical trials and efforts are underway to adjust the EDSS \\nto account for cognition.127\\nWe suggest that the SDMT is a biomarker of disease \\nactivity. Early cognitive impairment is a harbinger of future \\nneurological disability and employment loss. Account ing \\nfor cognitive relapse could enhance statistical power in \\nclinical trials in which the annualised relapse rate is the \\nprimary outcome. In the clinic, ignoring or missing cogni\\xad\\ntive changes could delay offering rehabilitative therapies.\\nIf cognitive impairment is missed, patients might be \\ndeprived of effective treatment. Debate continues about \\nsymptomatic pharmacological therapies, although some \\nstudies are encouraging.98 There is a growing literature \\nsupporting the effects of cognitive training and these \\ntreatments should be made available to patients with \\nmultiple sclerosis (table). Considering research findings \\nindicating that atrophy of key grey matter hubs and \\nnetwork disruption occur early in multiple sclerosis, \\ninterventions for cognitive impairment should also be \\napplied early in the disease course.\\nIn conclusion, the literature emboldens us to recom\\xad\\nmend the routine appraisal of cognitive function in \\npatients with multiple sclerosis for both clinical and \\nresearch purposes. Such evaluation will broaden the \\nunder stan ding of situations in which no other evidence \\nof dis ease activity is reported, identify patients in need of \\nearly intervention, and enhance the appreciation of the \\nclinical relevance of disease \\xadmodifying therapies. Tests \\nmeasuring CPS, such as the SDMT, are reproducible, \\nsensitive, and easily applied, and testing will most certainly \\nbecome more accessible with technological developments. \\nContributors\\nRHBB was the lead writer and originated the concept, design, table, and \\nfigures for the paper.

Addi -\\ntionally, the study of CNN-derived attention maps, which indicate the most relevant anatomical features for \\nCNN-based decisions, has the potential to uncover key disease mechanisms leading to disability accumulation. \\nFrom a cohort of patients prospectively followed up after a first demyelinating attack, we selected those with \\nT1-weighted and T2-FLAIR brain MRI sequences available for image analysis and a clinical assessment performed \\nwithin the following six months (N = 319). Patients were divided into two groups according to expanded \\ndisability status scale (EDSS) score: ≥ 3.0 and < 3.0. A 3D-CNN model predicted the class using whole-brain MRI \\nscans as input. A comparison with a logistic regression (LR) model using volumetric measurements as explan -\\natory variables and a validation of the CNN model on an independent dataset with similar characteristics (N =\\n440) were also performed. The layer-wise relevance propagation method was used to obtain individual attention \\nmaps. \\nThe CNN model achieved a mean accuracy of 79% and proved to be superior to the equivalent LR-model \\n(77%). Additionally, the model was successfully validated in the independent external cohort without any re- \\ntraining (accuracy = 71%). Attention-map analyses revealed the predominant role of frontotemporal cortex \\nand cerebellum for CNN decisions, suggesting that the mechanisms leading to disability accrual exceed the mere \\npresence of brain lesions or atrophy and probably involve how damage is distributed in the central nervous \\nsystem.   \\n1. Introduction \\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous \\nsystem characterised by inflammation, demyelination and \\nneurodegeneration, being one of the main non-traumatic causes of \\nirreversible disability in young adults. The exact cause of MS and the \\npathological mechanisms ultimately leading to an irreversible accumu -\\nlation of disability are still unknown.

DL techniques are not dependent on pre-defined features, instead \\nare capable of automatically extracting relevant information from raw \\nor minimally processed data. \\nIn neuroimaging, the use of CNN approaches has been useful not only \\nto extract biomarkers from MRI images, but also to address the classi -\\nfication and the prediction of different diseases ( Lian et al., 2021; van \\nder Burgh et al., 2017; Venugopalan et al., 2021 ). However, the use of \\nDL techniques to predict disease progression is still largely unexplored. \\nSome recent studies have presented promising results for future pre -\\ndiction of disability ( Roca et al., 2020; Storelli et al., 2022; Tousignant \\net al., 2019 ) and cross-sectional patient stratification ( Cruciani et al., \\n2021; Marzullo et al., 2019 ). \\nNew tendencies in the field have also put emphasis on producing \\nexplainable DL-based techniques, with the goal of disentangling the \\nreason behind DL decisions, therefore providing additional information \\nthat could be extremely useful to the end users enhancing data insights \\n( Bach et al., 2015; Simonyan et al., 2013; Springenberg et al., 2014 ). \\nThis task of deciphering the “ black box ” of DL-based models in MS has \\nrecently been studied for disease diagnosis ( Eitel et al., 2019; Lopatina \\net al., 2020 ) and MS phenotype signature decrypting ( Cruciani et al., \\n2021 ). All these studies concluded that the use of the layer-wise rele -\\nvance propagation (LRP)( Bach et al., 2015 ), among other (similar) \\nmethods, is the most promising tool for these analyses providing indi -\\nvidual heatmaps for each subject, called attention maps, reflecting the \\nvoxel-specific relevance to the classification output, according to the DL \\nmodel, in an easy and intuitive way. \\nThe main goal of this work was to build a DL-model able to accu -\\nrately classify MS patients based on their disability level, while ana -\\nlysing the CNN-derived attention maps in order to understand the \\nreasons behind the decisions taken by the DL-model. We believe these \\nanalyses may get us closer to deciphering the physiopathological \\nmechanisms responsible for clinical progression in MS. \\n2. Materials and methods \\n2.1. Datasets \\n2.1.1. In-house dataset \\nThe data used for our experiments is part of a larger in-house cohort \\nof patients followed over time after their first demyelinating attack (or \\nclinically isolated syndrome, CIS), the Barcelona CIS cohort, from the \\nMultiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia (Cemcat), Vall d ’ Hebron Uni -\\nversity Hospital (VHUH) ( Tintore et al., 2015 ). This is a prospective \\ncohort started in 1995 and is still in course. The selected subjects ’ \\nacquisition dates run from 2010 to 2020. The inclusion criteria was not \\ndependent on the clinical phenotype at the scan acquisition time point. \\nOur only requirement was that patients had to have experienced a CIS. \\nApproval was received from the Vall d ’ Hebron Institute of Research – \\nResearch and Ethics Committee (XMG-INT-2014-01 and PR(AG)389/ \\n2021) and informed consent was obtained from each patient conforming \\nthe cohort. \\nFor this cross-sectional study, we included all patients after their first \\ndemyelinating attack who had at least one brain MRI scan available for \\nimage analysis and a clinical examination within six months after the \\nscan. Clinical examinations included the assessment on the Expanded \\nDisability Status Scale (EDSS) score ( Kurtzke, 1983 ). EDSS ranges from \\n0 to 10. An EDSS of 3.0 is commonly recognised as the boundary be -\\ntween mild or no-disability vs moderate disability status ( Amato et al., \\n2008; Tintor ´e et al., 2006; Tintore et al., 2015 ). \\nWe included 319 unique patients in the study, making a total dataset \\nof 382 scans i.e., for 33 patients we used one or more MRI scans, per -\\nformed at different time-points after the first attack. The experiments \\nwere carried out with a fold cross validation strategy. Not to bias the \\nresults of the models during the cross validation strategy, we ensured \\nthat all MRI scans from a given patient were included in the same fold, \\npreventing their use for training and testing at the same time. Each scan \\nwas matched with the first EDSS score obtained within the following six \\nmonths after the MRI acquisition. \\nThe whole in-house dataset was acquired in the same centre with five \\ndifferent Siemens scanner models at two different magnetic fields (1.5 T \\n– 3.0 T). For all scanners, the MRI protocol included sagittal 3D T1 \\nmagnetization prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) and transverse \\nT2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR). The acquisition \\nprotocols of each scanner are summarised in Table 1 . \\n2.1.2. External validation (MS PATHS) dataset \\nMS PATHS (Multiple Sclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and \\nHealth Solutions)( Mowry et al., 2020 ) is a learning health system in MS, \\nstarted in 2016, comprising a collaborative network of 10 healthcare \\ncentres, providing standardised routinely-acquired clinical and MRI \\ndata. From this large database, we randomly selected a subset, with \\nrepresentation of all grades of disability, to be used as an independent \\ntest set from the models trained with the in-house dataset. The resultant \\nset was composed of 440 patients with 3D T1 MPRAGE and 3D T2-FLAIR \\nsequences from four different Siemens 3 T scanner models from six \\ndifferent sites (excluding the provider of our in-house dataset). All im -\\nages acquired using standardised image acquisition protocols, which \\ncorrespond to the 3D acquisition protocol of the Tim Trio in Table 1 . All \\npatients completed the (patient-reported outcome) Patient Determined \\nDisease Steps (PDDS) score ( Rizzo et al., 2004 ). The PDDS score ranges \\nbetween 0 and 8 and has been proven to have a strong correlation with \\nthe EDSS score ( Learmonth et al., 2013 ). \\n2.2. Image Pre-processing \\nThe same image pre-processing was applied to both datasets, in- \\nhouse dataset and MS PATHS (external validation dataset from now \\non). All T1-weighted (T1-w) and T2-FLAIR sequences were pre- \\nprocessed with (i) bias correction ( Tustison et al., 2010 ), (ii) skull- \\nstripping ( Isensee et al., 2019 ), (iii) registration ( Jenkinson & Smith, \\n2001 ) to MNI152 space (1x1x1mm\\n3\\n), as well as co-registration of T2- \\nFLAIR sequences to T1-w space, and (iv) min – max voxel intensity \\nnormalisation. \\n2.3. Proposed CNN method \\nThe proposed pipeline to stratify patients based on EDSS < 3.0 and \\nEDSS ≥ 3.0 is summarised in Fig. 1 . For the external validation experi -\\nment, patients were classified into PDDS < 3.0 (no or mild disability) \\nand PDDS ≥ 3.0 (moderate disability), since PDDS scores ≥ 3.0 indicate \\nmoderate-marked disability, equivalent to EDSS ≥ 3.0 ( Learmonth et al., \\n2013 ). \\nAfter fully pre-processing the whole-brain T2-FLAIR and T1-w scans, \\nthe volumes were cropped to the brain region obtaining the input patch \\nwith a fixed size of 144x184x152mm\\n3\\n. These patches were used as input \\nto train and test the CNN. When testing on new data, the output pre -\\ndiction was propagated to provide the LRP heatmap, complementing the \\nL.

Network architecture \\nThe proposed DL network was inspired by the ResNet CNN archi -\\ntecture ( He et al., 2016 ), built with three-dimensional (3D) layers. Each \\nresidual block is based on 3D convolutional layers that produce 3x3x3 \\nand 1x1x1 kernel convolution layers, normalised with batch normal -\\nisation and activated with a leaky rectified linear unit (LeakyReLU). As \\nshown in Fig. 2 , the architecture was composed of four residual blocks \\nwith an increasing number of kernels k (16, 32, 64 and 128), followed by \\na 2x2x2 downscale max pooling operation. Afterwards, the feature map \\nextracted was projected in a global adaptive max pooling (GAP) layer to \\nreduce feature dimensionality. The produced vector was fed into three \\nsuccessive 1x1x1 3D convolutional layers, with k = 128, 64, 2 , where the \\nfirst two were activated with a ReLU and the last one with a Softmax, \\nproviding the probability to belong to one class or another. \\n2.3.2. Training procedure \\nThe model was trained using only the in-house dataset. A 7-fold \\npatient cross-validation strategy was used to train and test the model. \\nWe sampled the folds to keep the same class distribution in each one, \\nwhile following the distribution present along the dataset.

We set a threshold of 0.5 for this probability. After inference, the probability obtained from the model is fed into the LRP algorithm to backpropagate \\nthrough the CNN and obtain the attention map. As shown in b, the training procedure is only performed with the in-house database in a cross-validation strategy, \\nhence obtaining different models.

A \\nrandom Gaussian noise ( σ = 0.02) was also used as data augmentation to \\ncreate intensity variation on both channels (T1-w and T2-FLAIR). \\nWe trained the model for a maximum of 200 epochs, with a fixed \\nbatch size of two, and an early stopping strategy based on the validation \\nloss behaviour to prevent overfitting. Every epoch the whole training set \\nwas evaluated. The model was optimised with Adam ( Kingma & Ba, \\n2015 ) with a learning decay strategy depending on the validation per -\\nformance and trained by minimising a weighted cross-entropy loss as \\ncost function. \\n2.3.3. Inference \\nFollowing the same sampling procedure described for training, the \\nwhole 3D brain was used as input through the trained model providing \\nthe output probabilities to belong to one class or another. The final \\nclassification was determined by the maximum of both probabilities, \\nwith a threshold fixed at 0.5. \\n2.4. Logistic regression model \\nTo assess whether our CNN method was superior to a more con -\\nventional statistical approach, we also built a logistic regression (LR) \\nmodel. For the LR, the disability class ( EDSS < 3.0 / EDSS ≥ 3.0 ) was \\nconsidered as the dependent variable (output) and the different volu -\\nmetric measures were considered as the explanatory variables (input). \\nVolumetric measures included: WM, GM, total intracranial, and lateral \\nventricle volumes, closely related to atrophy measures. These were \\ncalculated from the extracted brain parcellation atlas ( Henschel et al., \\n2020 ) using the T1-w lesion filled ( Prados et al., 2016 ). Brain lesion \\nvolume was also computed from the automatically extracted masks \\nobtained using LST ( Schmidt et al., 2012 ) and included as explanatory \\nvariable. \\n2.5. External validation \\nInference on the external validation dataset was computed using \\ndirectly the trained models on the in-house dataset. As seen in Fig. 1 b, \\nthe reported results were obtained using a majority voting of the seven \\ndifferent models. \\nAdditionally, the LR-models built on the in-house dataset were \\napplied to the external validation dataset in exactly the same way. \\n2.6. Attention Maps: LRP \\nTo investigate the decisions made by the CNN, attention maps were \\ncomputed in the input image space to show which were the regions that \\nsupport the decisions taken by the CNN. The method used for that was \\nthe LRP ( Bach et al., 2015 ). This technique decodes the resulting clas -\\nsification output through the network, propagating the relevance layer \\nby layer, obtaining a heatmap on the input space with each voxel \\ncontribution. \\nFor this study, we extracted the individual LRP heatmaps for each \\npatient of the in-house dataset. The implementation of the method was \\ninspired in Pytorch-LRP ( B ¨ohle et al., 2019 ), and adapted to our specific \\nCNN, with β = 0, only reflecting the positive contributions that led the \\nclassification to the winning class. The decision of choosing only the \\npositive contributions was made based on previous literature findings \\n( B ¨ohle et al., 2019 ) and corroborated with preliminary analyses on our \\nown data that showed that the negative contributions did not add \\nadditional information. \\nThe resulting LRP heatmaps were evaluated (i) individually and (ii) \\nas a class-average prediction. \\n2.6.1. Individual attention map analyses \\nIndividually, the attention maps were assessed visually and quali -\\ntatively showing which voxels contributed the most to the classification \\ngiven by the model inference. Additionally, semi-quantitative analyses \\nof the individual attention maps were carried out, multiplying such \\nmaps by a parcellation map. This allowed us to classify the relevant \\nvoxels for the CNN decision into the different anatomical areas. For this \\npurpose, we set a threshold at the 95% percentile of positive relevance, \\nto catch up the most relevant areas in each case, although other \\nthresholds have been studied (see Supplementary Material ). \\n2.6.2. Class-average attention map analyses \\nClass-average attention maps were also built for visual inspection, \\nthrough averaging the individual values of the attention maps across the \\nsubjects of each one of the prediction results: true positives (TP), false \\npositives (FP), false negatives (FN), and true negatives (TN). In addition, \\neach class-average map was multiplied by the parcellation map, and a \\nmean value per anatomical area was obtained. This allowed us to \\nidentify the anatomical areas with greatest relevance. \\n2.6.3. Voxel-wise regression to explain individual attention maps \\nWe then carried out a quantitative analysis based on the LRP heat -\\nmaps aiming at investigating to what extent the variability within each \\nvoxel (across independent subjects) of the attention map could be \\nexplained by the presence of lesions and atrophy, the best-known con -\\ntributors to disability in MS, at the voxel level. \\nFor that, we first grouped our subjects by the predicted vs real class \\n(TP, FP, FN, TN). We then computed voxel-wise regression models, one \\nper each prediction group (i.e., TP, FN, FP, TN), where the LRP value at \\neach voxel (considering all individual LRP heatmaps of the same group) \\nwas the dependent variable. As explanatory variables of these voxel- \\nwise regression models we included: i) voxel-wise binary indicator of \\nlesion (obtained from individual T2-FLAIR scans), and ii) voxel-wise \\nvalue describing the deformation suffered by the T1-w scan when \\nFigure 2.

The latter variable (ii) was used as \\nproxy for atrophy, being aware that the common template is based on \\nhealthy controls. After this step we obtained four voxel-wise maps of R- \\nsquared values, where each voxel indicated the proportion of the vari -\\nability of the LRP value that could be explained by the presence of le -\\nsions and native-to-MNI deformations. Additionally, we estimated the \\nstandardised beta coefficient for each one of the explanatory variables, \\nwhich indicated the relative importance of each one of these for the \\nprediction of the dependent variable, being the two standardised beta \\nmaps comparable (since they were in the same scale). \\n2.7. Evaluation measures of the classification models \\nTo evaluate the performance of the DL-based and LR-models, we \\nused the following metrics:  \\n• Balanced accuracy in correctly classifying each patient by means of \\ntheir EDSS, \\nAccuracy =\\nTP + TN\\nTP + TN + FP + FN\\n(1)    \\n• Sensitivity of correctly classified subjects with EDSS ≥ 3.0 , \\nSensitivity =\\nTP\\nTP + FN\\n(2)    \\n• Specificity of correctly classified subjects with EDSS < 3.0 , \\nSpecificity =\\nTN\\nTN + FP\\n(3)  \\nwhere TP are the number of correctly classified patients with EDSS ≥\\n3.0 , TN are the number of correctly classified patients with EDSS < 3.0 , \\nFP are the number of patients with EDSS < 3.0 classified as they have \\nEDSS ≥ 3.0 , and FN are the number of patients with EDSS ≥ 3.0 classified \\nas they have EDSS < 3.0 . The results are reported in terms of mean and \\nstandard deviation for the 7-fold cross validation computed on the in- \\nhouse dataset and as majority voting of the 7 models for the external \\nvalidation dataset. \\n2.8. Descriptive statistics and other general aspects \\nDescriptive statistics included comparison between the two groups \\n( EDSS < 3.0 / EDSS ≥ 3.0 ). Chi-square or mixed-effects linear regression \\nmodels accounting for repeated measures were used, as appropriate. \\nThe proposed method and analyses were entirely implemented in \\nPython ( https://www.python.org/ ), using the Pytorch library ( Paszke \\net al., 2019 ). We ran all the experiments on a GNU/Linux machine box \\nrunning Ubuntu 20.04, with 128 GB RAM. For training the model, we \\nused a single Quadro RTX 5000 GPU (NVIDIA Corp, USA) with 16 GB \\nVRAM memory. \\n3. Results \\n3.1. Evaluation of DL-models: in-house dataset \\nOut of the 319 patients, 104 were assigned with EDSS ≥ 3.0 and 215 \\nwith EDSS < 3.0 . This meant a volume of 215 MRI scans with EDSS < \\n3.0 , and 167 MRI scans with EDSS ≥ 3.0 (non-confirmed). The two \\nstratification groups showed comparable demographic, clinical and MRI \\ncharacteristics, as summarised in Table 2 . The full cohort EDSS median \\nwas 2.0, with a median of 1.5 (in range 0.0 – 2.5) for patients with EDSS \\n< 3.0 and 4.0 (in range 3.0 – 9.0) for patients with EDSS ≥ 3.0 . Patients \\nwith EDSS ≥ 3.0 had a longer disease duration than patients with EDSS \\n< 3.0 , with a similar age at CIS with a mean age of approximately 30 \\nyears old ( SD = 8 ). Compared with patients with EDSS < 3.0 , patients \\nwith EDSS ≥ 3.0 had lower tissue volumes, GM, WM and total intra -\\ncranial volume, and higher ventricle volume and lesion load. \\nThe average accuracy of the in-house dataset across the seven folds \\nwith the whole brain input patch was 79% ( SD = 4% ), with a sensitivity \\nof 77% ( SD = 5% ) identifying patients with EDSS ≥ 3.0 , and a specificity \\nof 81% ( SD = 9% ) identifying patients with EDSS < 3.0. \\n3.2. Comparison with a LR-model \\nThe LR-model built with the six brain volumes corresponding to WM, \\nGM, ventricles, brainstem and cerebellum, intracranial volume and \\nlesion load, achieved an accuracy of 77% ( SD = 7% ), with a sensitivity of \\n68% ( SD = 10% ) when classifying patients with EDSS ≥ 3.0 and a \\nspecificity of 86% (SD = 6%). Therefore, the LR-model trained with MRI \\npre-extracted features showed a 10% lower sensitivity than DL-based \\nmodels. When considering other input combinations with fewer fea -\\ntures, the LR-model obtained always inferior results than the CNN \\nTable 2 \\nDemographic, clinical and brain MRI characteristics of MS patients from the in- \\nhouse database.   \\nFull cohort \\nN\\nPAC/SCAN \\n=\\n319/382 \\nEDSS < 3.0 \\nN = 215/ \\n215 \\nEDSS ≥ 3.0 \\nN = 104/ \\n167 \\np -value \\nFemale, n (%) 207 (65) 147 (64) 60 (58)  0.08 \\nAge at CIS, years, mean \\n[range] \\n32.3 [14 – 50] 32.4 \\n[14 – 49] \\n32.2 \\n[14 – 50]  \\n0.78 \\nConfirmed diagnosis\\na\\n, \\nn (%) \\n260 (82) 160 (74) 100 (96)  < 0.001 \\nAge at diagnose, years, \\nmean [range] \\n33.2 [14 – 59] 33.5 \\n[16 – 59] \\n32.7 \\n[14 – 55]  \\n0.43 \\nCIS topography, n (%)     < 0.001 \\nBrain stem 83 (26) 59 (27) 24 (23)  \\nOptic nerve 98 (31) 74 (35) 24 (23)  \\nSpinal cord 98 (31) 60 (28) 38 (37)  \\nOther 40 (12) 22 (10) 18 (17)  \\nMS topography, n (%)     < 0.001 \\nCIS 123 (39) 106 (49.5) 17 (16)  \\nSP 41 (13) 1 (0.5) 40 (39)  \\nRR 155 (48) 108 (50) 47 (45)  \\nPresence of OB, n (%)     < 0.001 \\nPositive 194 (61) 115 (53) 79 (75)  \\nNegative 75 (23) 64 (30) 11 (12)  \\nUnknown 50 (16) 36 (17) 14 (13)  \\nDD, years, mean (SD) 10.4 (7.0) 7.6 (6.6) 14.0 (5.6)  < 0.001 \\nEDSS, median [range] 2.0 [0.0 – 9.0] 1.5 \\n[0.0 – 2.5] \\n5.0 \\n[3.0 – 9.0]  \\n< 0.001 \\nLesion load, ml, mean \\n(SD) \\n27.5 (39.9) 10.4 (13.1) 49.6 (50.7)  < 0.001 \\nVentricles vol, ml, \\nmean (SD) \\n29.7 (19.8) 21.5 (9.6) 40.2 (25.3)  < 0.001 \\nGM vol, ml, mean (SD) 787.9 (64.0) 813.1 \\n(48.3) \\n755.4 \\n(67.2)  \\n< 0.001 \\nWM vol, ml, mean (SD) 694.8 (68.0) 707.5 \\n(54.3) \\n678.3 \\n(79.6)  \\n< 0.001 \\nBrain vol, ml, mean \\n(SD) \\n1542.7 \\n(103.7) \\n1572.0 \\n(83.7) \\n1504.8 \\n(114.4)  \\n< 0.001 \\nScanner model     < 0.001 \\nAvanto, n (%) 64 (17) 19 (9) 45 (27)  \\nAvanto Fit, n (%) 64 (17) 43 (20) 21 (13)  \\nSymphony, n (%) 10 (3) 7 (3) 3 (2)  \\nSymphony Tim, n (%) 51 (13) 13 (6) 38 (23)  \\nTim Trio, n (%) 193 (50) 133 (62) 60 (36)  \\nPAC : patients; EDSS : expanded disability status scale; CIS : clinically isolated \\nsyndrome; SP: secondary progressive; RR: relapsing remitting; OB : oligoclonal \\nbands; DD : disease duration; GM : grey matter; WM : white matter. \\na\\nMS confirmed diagnosis by McDonald 2017 criteria.

External validation dataset \\nTable 3 summarises the demographic, clinical and MRI data char -\\nacteristics of the patients included in the external validation dataset. In \\nthis external validation dataset, 220 patients were categorised to the \\ngroup with PDDS ≥ 3.0 and 220 with PDDS < 3.0 . The full median \\ncohort PDDS was 2.5, with a median of 0.5 (in range 0.0 – 2.0) for the \\ngroup of no or mild disability patients ( PDDS < 3.0 ) and 5.0 (in range \\n3.0 – 7.0) for the group of more disabled patients ( PDDS ≥ 3.0 ). As for the \\nin-house dataset, the disease duration was longer in patients with more \\ndisability, with a mean age at diagnosis of 36 years old, and MRI char -\\nacteristics kept the same relation between groups. \\nIn this validation dataset, the majority voting system after applying \\nthe seven DL models trained on the in-house cohort showed an accuracy \\nof 71%, a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 75%. In contrast, when \\nwe applied the different LR-models to the validation dataset, we ach -\\nieved accuracies close to 50% only. \\n3.4. DL-based attention maps analyses \\n3.4.1. Individual attention maps \\nIndividual attention maps showed that, in both disability groups, the \\nmost relevant voxels that led the classification decisions were mainly \\nlocated in the periventricular WM regions, which often contained \\ndemyelinating lesions, and frontal and temporal cortical areas (see \\nexample Fig. 3 a). Fig. 3 b shows a case-example of the distribution of \\nrelevant voxels across the different anatomical regions, considering all \\nvoxels with a relevance above a 95% percentile. Other thresholds were \\nalso explored (see Supplementary Fig. 1 ), however insignificant changes \\nin the distribution were observed. \\n3.4.2. Class-average attention maps \\nClass-average maps revealed that the most relevant areas were the \\nfrontal cortex, cerebellar cortex, periventricular WM, temporal cortex \\nand lateral ventricles, as shown in Fig. 4 . The ranking of these regions \\nslightly varied across the different groups (TP, FP, TN, FN). For the \\npatients classified with EDSS ≥ 3.0 (TP, FP), the relevance of periven -\\ntricular and frontal WM, where most lesions are located, was particu -\\nlarly high. Instead, for no or mild-disability statuses (TN, FN), the \\nrelevance of the cortex, especially frontal and temporal cortical areas, \\nand that of the cerebellum were the highest. \\n3.4.3. Voxel-wise regression analyses \\nAfter carrying out the voxel-wise regressions on the in-house dataset, \\nwe obtained R-squared maps for the four prediction groups ( Fig. 5 ). In \\ngeneral, the R-squared values were low in all four groups, and mostly \\nranged between 0 and 0.2. In the correctly classified groups (TP, TN), \\nthe R-squared values were even lower (0 – 0.1). That means that in these \\ngroups, at most the 80% of the variability of the attention map could not \\nbe explained by the presence of lesions (observed in T2-FLAIR scans) or \\nthe native-to-MNI deformation (of the T1-w scans), calculated through \\nthe Jacobian determinant. \\nWhen focused on the maps of partial R-squared, we found that values \\nwere always greater for the presence of lesions than for the Jacobian \\ndeterminant ( Fig. 5 ). \\n4. Discussion \\nIn this work, we investigated the use of DL-models to classify MS \\npatients according to their disability status while trying to provide an \\nexplanation of the decisions taken by the CNN. Our findings showed that \\na DL-based model using only brain MRI scans, without any guidance, \\nwas able to stratify MS patients with high accuracy (79%) when testing \\ndata from the same cohort, and 71% when testing images from an un -\\nseen database (external validation dataset). Furthermore, the compari -\\nson with the LR-model brought to light the superiority of the CNN \\nmodel. Finally, our attention-map analyses revealed that the most \\nrelevant anatomical areas that the CNN model used to decide the level of \\npatients ’ disability were the frontotemporal cortex and the cerebellum \\nand did not depend on the mere presence of lesions or atrophy in these \\nlocations. \\nCompared with previously reported studies that used DL-based \\nmodels to perform predictions of MS progression, our work presents \\nsome similarities and some major differences. Despite the differences in \\nthe target of the classification, i.e., cross-sectional vs future predictions, \\nall published studies ( Storelli et al., 2022; Tousignant et al., 2019 ), like \\nours, used the whole brain as input to the network. However, in our \\nstudy, we only used routinely-acquired T1-w and T2-FLAIR MRI data, \\nwhereas other studies required the use of several MRI modalities and \\nadditional masks ( Tousignant et al., 2019 ) to achieve similar accuracies. \\nOf note, we validated our CNN model on an external, unseen cohort, \\nwhere the performance of the classification task was more than \\nacceptable, without needing any recalibration or re-training of the \\nmodel. This utterly necessary step of validating the CNN model \\n(although uncommon in the literature) strengthens our findings, laying \\nthe foundation for future longitudinal, comprehensive models of MS \\ndisease progression. Furthermore, having at hand an excellent tool to \\ndiscriminate patients according to their disability level may be \\nextremely useful in contexts where the EDSS score is not obtained as part \\nof routine practice ( Bove et al., 2023 ). Such a discriminating tool may \\nallow the fast identification of patients who already present a certain \\ndegree of disability and who, therefore, are at high risk of reaching \\nunfavourable clinical outcomes ( Signori et al., 2023 ). To further assess \\nour model robustness to the actual disability threshold used to classify \\npatients or the distribution of disability scores in the given study pop -\\nulation, we carried out a post-hoc analysis on the in-house cohort where \\nwe only considered those patients with an EDSS ≤ 2.0 or ≥ 4.0 . We \\nobserved that the performance of the model only improved by 2%, i.e., \\nwe obtained an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 81%, 79%, and \\n83%, respectively. This slight increase in model performance may \\nhighlight the robustness of our CNN model, whose accuracy did not \\nseem too dependent on the threshold used to classify patients into \\ndisability groups or how the disability scores were distributed in our \\ncohort. Other data-related aspects that may have affected model per -\\nformance include the imbalance between classes in terms of scanner \\nmodels. That is, while 62% of patients in the group with an EDSS < 3.0 \\nwere scanned in the Tim Trio scanner, only a 36% of patients with an \\nEDSS ≥ 3.0 did so ( Table 2 ). For this reason, we performed a post-hoc \\nTable 3 \\nDemographic, clinical and brain MRI characteristics of MS patients from the \\nexternal database.   \\nFull cohort  \\nN = 440 \\nPDDS < 3.0 \\nN = 220 \\nPDDS ≥ 3.0 \\nN = 220 \\np -value \\nFemale, n (%) 310 (70) 170 (77) 140 (64)  0.007 \\nAge at diagnosis, years, \\nmean [range] \\n36.8 \\n[19 – 69] \\n36.1 \\n[19 – 62] \\n37.6 \\n[19 – 69]  \\n0.24 \\nDD, years, mean (SD) 11.5 (9.1) 8.5 (7.6) 14.9 (9.5)  < 0.001 \\nPDDS, median [range] 2.5 \\n[0.0 – 7.0] \\n0.5 \\n[0.0 – 2.0] \\n5.0 \\n[3.0 – 7.0]  \\n< 0.001 \\nLesion load, ml, mean \\n(SD) \\n13.2 (24.7) 7.9 (11.7) 18.5 (32.0)  < 0.001 \\nVentricles vol, ml, mean \\n(SD) \\n35.9 (24.0) 28.7 (17.4) 43.1 (27.4)  < 0.001 \\nGM vol, ml, mean (SD) 804.6 \\n(73.5) \\n828.4 \\n(64.6) \\n779.7 \\n(74.0)  \\n< 0.001 \\nWM vol, ml, mean (SD) 706.1 \\n(53.4) \\n718.6 \\n(47.3) \\n693.6 \\n(56.3)  \\n< 0.001 \\nBrain vol, ml, mean (SD) 1496.4 \\n(92.8) \\n1526.2 \\n(79.7) \\n1466.5 \\n(95.7)  \\n< 0.001 \\nPDDS : patient determined disease steps; DD : disease duration; GM : grey matter; \\nWM : white matter. \\nL.

Notice that the databases used were \\nconformed of different scanner models and magnetic fields, to which the \\nDL-models were more robust, having < 10% drop in performance when \\ntesting on the external database. On the other hand, LR-models are \\nbased on obtained volumetric measurements that need to be previously \\ncomputed using different tools which can be affected by changes on the \\nMRI scanners and image protocols used to acquire the data. Thus, \\nconsidering that volumetric measures have been frequently used as \\noutcome measures in clinical trials ( Tur et al., 2018b ), our findings \\nsuggest that DL-based discriminative tools may also be considered as \\ntrial outcomes, given that seem to explain clinical outcome better than \\nconventional volumetric measures feeding into a LR model. Further \\nresearch in this regard, evaluating the CNN model ’ s sensitivity to clin -\\nical change, is therefore warranted. \\nFinally, in this study we attempted to understand the reasons behind \\nFig. 3.

Moreover, other studies have mainly investigated the classifica -\\ntion between healthy controls and patients ( B ¨ohle et al., 2019; Eitel \\net al., 2019; Lopatina et al., 2020 ), whereas the task of classifying pa -\\ntients into different disability classes, as in our study, is possibly much \\nmore challenging, given the continuous nature of the disease. Thus, we \\nwent a step further trying to apply such methods on patients only , i.e., \\nmoderately disabled and mildly or non-disabled, with a priori no clear \\npathological boundaries between them, making it very difficult their \\nidentification by providing only brain MRI data to the model. With these \\nanalyses we found that the voxels with the highest relevance for the CNN \\nto make the final decisions were in the frontal and temporal cortex, \\nfollowed by brainstem/cerebellum, and periventricular WM. \\nThe importance of cortical GM for disease progression has been \\nsuggested in several studies, although the proposed underlying patho -\\nlogical mechanisms differ across studies. For instance, loss of cortical \\nGM volume ( Cordano et al., 2022 ), microstructural cortical damage, \\nreflected by increased total sodium concentration ( Collorone et al., \\n2021 ), or grey matter demyelination ( Gilmore et al., 2009 ), including \\nthe presence of visible lesions in the cortex ( Madsen et al., 2022 ), may all \\ncontribute to the accumulation of disability. Furthermore, the loss of the \\nphysiological balance between the cortical thickness of different areas \\nhas also been proposed as a process potentially leading to clinical \\ndysfunction in MS ( Tur et al., 2018a; Tur et al., 2019 ). However, no \\nproper head-to-head comparisons across mechanisms have been carried \\nout, which makes it difficult to understand the hierarchy or dynamics of \\nsuch pernicious pathological events. In any case, it is plausible that our \\nCNN has captured at least some of the imaging features related to them. \\nThe consistency across individuals in terms of these areas likely reveal \\ngenuine differences between subjects, possibly related to atrophy, \\nalthough not only: looking at the results of the voxel-wise regression \\n( Fig. 5 ), it is possible that other pathological aspects, for example \\nchanges in image texture denoting underlying non-obvious demyelin -\\nation, may be playing a role too. On the other hand, it must be \\nacknowledged that some of the highlighted attentions in the cortex \\nmight also be caused by non-pathological aspects such as registration \\ninaccuracies. Although the high accuracy of the model might lead us to \\nthink that the potential impact of registration inaccuracies on model \\nperformance was not major, this would need to be assessed in further \\nstudies. That is, we are unable to discern if all the attentions were related \\nor not to pathological aspects, which is a limitation of the current study. \\nIt should also be highlighted the involvement of brainstem/cerebellum, \\nwhose role in disability progression in MS has been repeatedly seen in \\nthe literature ( Palesi et al., 2015; Savini et al., 2019; Tintore et al., \\n2010 ). Future studies should investigate whether those relevant imaging \\naspects present in the brainstem/cerebellum have the same pathological \\ntranslation as those of the relevant cortical areas. An interesting note is \\nthat the frontal cortex and the cerebellum have a strong anatomical \\nconnection through two distinct fronto-cerebellar pathways, which are \\nknown to be damaged in toxic conditions involving the CNS, such as \\nalcohol ( Rogers et al., 2012 ) or heroin abuse ( Wang et al., 2013 ). Future \\nstudies will elucidate whether these paths are also altered in MS and, \\nespecially, whether such alteration may be a key step in the develop -\\nment of irreversible disability. \\nThe relevance of periventricular WM may be related to the presence \\nof demyelinating lesions, which tend to appear in this location \\n( Thompson et al., 2018 ), but also to lateral and third ventricle \\nFig. 5.

Agreeing with that, cases with moderate disability presented a \\nhigher mean lesion load in periventricular WM than in mildly or non- \\ndisabled cases. \\nInterestingly, these structures are followed by the thalamus, which \\nalso appears to be very relevant for the CNNs, in line with previous \\nstudies showing the importance of deep GM structures for disease pro -\\ngression in MS ( Eshaghi et al., 2018 ). All these relevant areas were \\nbrought to light through both the individual attention map and the class- \\naverage map analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time \\nthat such areas have been identified as relevant for clinical progression \\nin MS in a completely hypothesis-free (unguided) manner, that is, \\nwithout forcing the model to pay attention to them. \\nRegarding the voxel-wise regression analysis, the most striking \\nfinding was that the attention within a voxel, which indicates the \\nimportance of a given voxel to decide the disability class of a given \\npatient, was not (only) explained by the mere presence of lesions or \\nnative-to-MNI deformation (used as proxy for volume change or atro -\\nphy) in that particular voxel. This may suggest that DL-based methods \\npay attention to more general aspects of the image, possibly focusing on \\ncomplex spatial relationships between voxel-wise information, consid -\\nering that distributional features of brain lesions might impact on \\ndisability progression ( Tur et al., 2022 ), or image texture-related in -\\nformation, maybe denoting microscopic processes such as underlying \\ndemyelination ( Gilmore et al., 2009 ). Of note, these more general as -\\npects of the image deserve further research and, anyway cannot be \\nsummarised as presence/absence of lesions and/or atrophy in a given \\npoint. \\nIn any case, our findings strongly support the use of DL-based \\nmethods to perform classification/prediction tasks where the input \\ndata is derived from images, in line with the superiority observed by our \\nCNN with respect to the LR-model. This confirms the potential of DL- \\nbased models to unveil key aspects of the disease which are uncatch -\\nable by the human eye. Future studies focusing on unveiling these as -\\npects are therefore warranted. \\nPotential implications for clinical practice of our findings may \\ninclude, in the short term, the application of CNN-based models to \\nautomatically classify patients according to their disability status using \\nonly routinely acquired brain MRI scans. This may be extremely useful \\nin situations where large-scale therapeutic interventions, which may \\nvary depending on the disability status of a given patient population, \\nneed to be planned in a relatively rapid manner. Other, mid-term im -\\nplications include those derived from the development of CNN-based \\nmodels to predict future disability, which may be extremely powerful \\nto manage patient expectations and design tailored treatment strategies. \\nThat is, we should acknowledge that this is a cross-sectional study and, \\ntherefore, no strong statements about prediction of disease prognosis \\nbased on our specific CNN model can be made. However, we believe that \\nour findings will help build powerful predictive models, possibly \\nfocusing on those areas identified as highly relevant through the \\nattention map analyses. Up to now, most of those CNN-based models for \\nfuture prediction that have been published so far show a relatively \\nlimited accuracy, implying that more research is sorely needed ( Roca \\net al., 2020; Storelli et al., 2022; Tousignant et al., 2019 ). \\nAmong the methodological considerations and possible limitations \\nof our study, it is worth mentioning the relatively small sample size, \\nconsidering the data needs of DL-based models. For this reason and to \\nmake the most of the data available, we did not apply any restriction to \\nthe disease duration of our patients and considered each individual scan \\nwhich could be matched to an EDSS score as an independent piece of \\ninformation. As future work, we would like to analyse the impact of \\nadding clinical data, such as disease duration, age at CIS or sex, on model \\nperformance. Additionally, we applied data augmentation strategies \\nwhen possible. As a result of all these strategies, the final (in-house) \\ndatabase used for training, overall, had enough variability, proving \\nrobustness and generalisation of our models to scans from the same \\nvendor. Even though the data from the different MR scanner models \\nused for training were not balanced, they were so in terms of strength \\nfield. This was confirmed by the excellent reproducibility of the models \\nwhen we applied them to the external (i.e., completely unseen) valida -\\ntion cohort, despite the fact the disability score was not the same than \\nthe one used for training. Another remark relates to the fact that we did \\nnot account for potential disease-modifying treatment effects. Future \\nstudies accounting for these are therefore warranted. Concerning the \\nattention maps, they are limited by the lack of a ground truth. Surely, \\nother methodological choices could have been made, providing (prob -\\nably) slightly different results, which deserve further research. More -\\nover, we tried to relate the attention maps with well-known biomarkers \\nof the disease, whereas future studies should investigate the association \\nwith new, possibly more promising, biomarkers. \\n5. Conclusions \\nIn conclusion, our CNN model was able to stratify MS patients based \\non their disability score solely using a single time-point brain MRI (T1-w \\nand T2-FLAIR sequences) providing an excellent performance. \\nFurthermore, our findings bring to light the potential of DL-based \\nmodels to provide key information about the mechanisms responsible \\nfor the accumulation of disability in MS, suggesting the relevant role of \\nfrontotemporal cortex and cerebellum for the development of irrevers -\\nible disability. Importantly, these findings may have immediate and \\nespecially long-term implications for clinical practice, laying the foun -\\ndations for building powerful predictive models of future disability. \\nCRediT authorship contribution statement \\nLlucia Coll: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Data cura -\\ntion, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, \\nWriting – review & editing.

Rocca1,3,4 and Massimo Filippi 1,2,3,4,5 ✉\\n© The Author(s) 2023\\nNeuropsychiatric abnormalities may be broadly divided in two categories: disorders of mood, affect, and behavior and\\nabnormalities affecting cognition. Among these conditions, clinical depression, anxiety and neurocognitive disorders are the most\\ncommon in multiple sclerosis (MS), with a substantial impact on patients’ quality of life and adherence to treatments. Such\\nmanifestations may occur from the earliest phases of the disease but become more frequent in MS patients with a progressive\\ndisease course and more severe clinical disability. Although the pathogenesis of these neuropsychiatric manifestations has not\\nbeen fully deﬁned yet, brain structural and functional abnormalities, consistently observed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),\\ntogether with genetic and immunologic factors, have been suggested to be key players. Even though the detrimental clinical\\nimpact of such manifestations in MS patients is a matter of crucial importance, at present, they are often overlooked in the clinical\\nsetting. Moreover, the efﬁcacy of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches for their amelioration has been poorly\\ninvestigated, with the majority of studies showing marginal or no beneﬁcial effect of different therapeutic approaches, possibly due\\nto the presence of multiple and heterogeneous underlying pathological mechanisms and intrinsic methodological limitations. A\\nbetter evaluation of these manifestations in the clinical setting and improvements in the understanding of their pathophysiology\\nmay offer the potential to develop tools for differentiating these mechanisms in individual patients and ultimately provide a\\nprincipled basis for treatment selection. This review provides an updated overview regarding the pathophysiology of the most\\ncommon neuropsychiatric symptoms in MS, the clinical and MRI characteristics that have been associated with mood disorders (i.e.,\\ndepression and anxiety) and cognitive impairment, and the treatment approaches currently available or under investigation.\\nTranslational Psychiatry          (2023) 13:264 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-023-02555-7\\nINTRODUCTION\\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inﬂammatory, demyelinating\\nand neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous\\nsystem (CNS), often leading to the accumulation of irreversible\\nclinical disability [1].\\nDuring recent years, there has been an increasing under-\\nstanding of MS pathophysiology which has in ﬂuenced the\\ndevelopment of novel treatment approaches. Beside locomotor\\ndisability, the growing evidence of neuropsychiatric symptoms\\noccurrence in MS has provided new valuable insights in the\\npathophysiology of the disease, enabling novel therapeutic\\ntargets aimed to improve MS patients’ management [2, 3].\\nAmong neuropsychiatric abnormalities, cognitive impairment,\\nclinical depression, and anxiety are the most common with a\\nhigher frequency in MS patients compared to the general\\npopulation [4].\\nIt is now clear that the evaluation of physical disability should\\nbe combined with neuropsychological batteries and scales for a\\nmore detailed characterization of cognitive performance, depres-\\nsive and anxiety symptoms, often neglected in the clinical\\npractice, even though they have profound consequences on\\npatients’ daily activities and quality of life (QoL).\\nIn this scenario, the application of magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI) measures, which are speci ﬁc to different pathological\\nsubstrates of MS, has consistently shown that, in addition to\\ngenetic, environmental and immunologic factors, structural and\\nfunctional abnormalities in relevant brain regions and networks\\nmay contribute to identify the mechanisms of these hetero-\\ngeneous manifestations of the disease [3].

Other symptoms, such as neurovegetative symptoms, including\\nfatigue, loss of appetite or weight, and insomnia, are common also\\nin other medical conditions [6].\\nIf episodes of depression do not resolve and last for extended\\nperiods of time, this pattern is described as chronic depression. If\\ndepressive symptoms are present (on most days) for at least 2\\nyears without any periods of remission exceeding 2 months, the\\ncondition is termed persistent depressive disorder or dysthymia\\n[7].\\nThe 12-month prevalence of MDD in general population varies\\nconsiderably across countries but is approximately 6%, overall [8].\\nInterestingly, the 12-month prevalence of MDD is similar when\\ncomparing high-income countries (5.5%) with low- and middle-\\nincome countries (5.9%), suggesting that MDD is neither a simple\\nconsequence of modern day lifestyle in developed countries, nor\\npoverty [9].\\nIn MS, clinical depression is higher than in other neurologic\\ndisorders [10] and, depending on the reference point, is 3–10\\ntimes the rate in the general population [11].\\nAccording to a comprehensive systematic review [12], clinical\\ndepression represents the most prevalent comorbidity in MS\\n(23.7%), followed by anxiety (21.9%), hypertension (18.6%),\\nhypercholesterolemia (10.9%), and chronic lung disease (10%). A\\nrecent meta-analysis reported a higher prevalence of clinical\\ndepression in MS; the weighted prevalence of 58 studies on\\ndepression in MS was 30.5% (95% con ﬁdence intervals\\n[CI] = 26.3–35.1%) [13].\\nSimilarly to the general population, the prevalence peak is\\ngenerally between 45 and 59 years in these patients [ 14].\\nDifferently from other comorbidities, such as hypertension and\\nhypercholesterolemia, the prevalence of clinical depression seems\\nnot increasing with age [15]. While some studies reported a higher\\nprevalence of depressive symptoms in female MS patients with a\\nhistory of depression [16–18], others did not [19].\\nDepressive symptoms typically associate with a progressive MS\\ncourse, leading to severe consequences on cognitive performance\\nand worsening physical disability [20–22].\\nSeveral scales have been proposed to score depressive\\nsymptoms in MS patients (Table 1). According to the evidence-\\nbased guidelines of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN)\\n[23], the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scale is recommended\\nfor assessing depression in these patients [ 24]. It should be\\nmentioned that this scale has to be adapted, since some questions\\noverlap with disability. Other scales, including the BDI-II [25] and\\nMontgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) [26], are\\ncommonly used in clinical practice (Table1).\\nSeveral studies showed that depressive symptoms severity was\\nassociated with fatigue, even after adjusting for disability status,\\nand these conditions were signiﬁcant and independent predictors\\nof QoL in MS patients [20–22]. Depressive symptoms also related\\nto cognitive functioning in MS since they negatively impact\\nperformance of attention, working memory, executive functions\\nand information processing speed [27–30]. Indeed, MS patients\\nwith depressive symptoms have worse cognitive outcomes\\ncompared to HC but also to MS patients without depressive\\nsymptoms [22, 31, 32].\\nSuicide is a relevant consequence of depression with a\\nprevalence reported up to 22.1% in MS [33], twice compared to\\nthe general population [34]. Risk factors for the development of\\nsuicidal ideation include current depressive symptoms, being\\nfemale [35], young age at onset of MS, previous history of\\ndepression, social isolation, recent functional deterioration and\\nabuse of illicit substance [36, 37].\\nPathophysiology. The pathogenesis of MS-related depressive\\nsymptoms is multifactorial. Genetic, immunologic, structural and\\nfunctional brain damage might contribute to the presence of such\\nmanifestations in MS patients [38].\\nAlthough the role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of\\ndepression in MS has been poorly explored, a correlation between\\nthe presence of Apolipoproteinε2 allele and a decreased incidence\\nTable 1.

Pro-in ﬂammatory\\ncytokines may affect serotonin synthesis and reuptake in the CNS,\\nand, consequently, may lead to the malfunctioning of noradre-\\nnergic and serotoninergic circuits that represent the pathways\\ntargeted by several antidepressant drugs [ 42–44]. Speciﬁcally,\\ninterferon (IFN)-γ may induce tryptophan metabolism and higher\\nblood cytokine levels, in particular interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and\\ntumor necrosis factor-α, which might constitute the trigger for the\\nincreased secretion of adrenal corticosteroids through the\\nactivation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, linked\\nto the onset of depressive symptoms [42–44]. In MS, immune\\nsystem abnormalities are believed to occur before the onset of\\ndepression, but the suggestion that depression is always\\nsecondary to inﬂammation is controversial [40], because depres-\\nsion itself may compromise the immune system.\\nAs discussed below, structural and functional brain abnormal-\\nities, especially involving fronto-temporal and limbic cortices, are\\nalso related to the presence and worsening of depression in MS\\npatients. Notably, abnormalities in communication between key\\nanatomical areas involved in modulation of mood (i.e., amygdala\\nand ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) in relation to speciﬁc tasks\\nwere observed in MS patients, even in the absence of depression\\n[45]. These ﬁndings might explain, at least partially, the high\\nproportion of MS patients with depressive symptoms, as\\ndisconnection of a key mood-regulation pathway could compro-\\nmise an individual’s emotional adaptability when confronted by\\nthe vicissitudes of life.\\nMRI ﬁndings. MS is classically characterized by the formation of\\nmacroscopic focal white matter (WM) lesions and diffuse damage\\nto the so-called normal-appearing WM (NAWM) [ 1]. Besides,\\npathological and MRI studies have consistently shown the\\npresence of abnormalities also affecting deep gray matter (GM)\\nand cortex [1].\\nCompared to non-depressed, depressed MS patients showed\\nhigher brain T2-hyperintense lesion volume (LV) in the temporal\\nlobe [46] and arcuate fasciculus [ 47, 48], and higher T1-\\nhypointense WM LV in the superior frontal and parietal regions\\n[49]. The described lesions were located at the projection areas of\\nthe basal limbic system [46], in line with neuropathological studies\\nin depressed patients with Parkinson’s disease showing reduced\\nneuronal cell count in nuclei associated with the limbic system,\\nsuch as the raphe nuclei, the ventral segmental nuclei or the locus\\ncoeruleus [50, 51]. Notably, a similar localization of WM lesions was\\nalso observed in depressed patients with vascular pathology,\\nsuggesting a common pathogenesis of secondary depression [52].\\nRecently, advanced MRI techniques have shed light on brain\\nmicrostructural abnormalities associated with depression in MS\\npatients. A lower NAWM fractional anisotropy and a higher mean\\ndiffusivity in the NAGM in the temporal lobe and in inferior frontal\\nregions, and atrophy of cortical regions located in the bilateral frontal\\nlobes were found in MS patients with depression compared to those\\nwithout depression [53]. Atrophy of cortical regions located in the\\nbilateral frontal lobes and entorhinal cortex and cerebellum were also\\nsigniﬁcant predictors of depression [54–56]. An involvement of\\nhippocampus has also been described in depressed-MS patients, as\\ndemonstrated in a study where hippocampal atrophy correlated with\\nthe severity of depression [57].\\nMoreover, structural connectivity abnormalities between the right\\nhippocampus, right amygdala and frontal regions were associated\\nwith the presence of depression, suggesting that connectivity\\nalterations at the limbic-motor interface may explain the occurrence\\nof depression in MS patients [58].\\nFunctional MRI (fMRI) studies showed an increased activity of the\\nventrolateral prefrontal cortex, with, however, a trend to\\nhypoconnectivity with the amygdala and the medial prefrontal\\ncortex in MS patients with depression. This is possibly related to a\\nmaladaptive emotional coping that might cause a higher vulner-\\nability to depression of MS patients [45].\\nWhen evaluating resting state (RS) fMRI, a functional disconnection\\nof the hippocampus with regions of the default mode network due\\nto the accumulation of focal WM lesions has been found to be\\nassociated with depression [59], as well as an imbalance in the RS FC\\nof the salience network, executivecontrol network in cognitively\\npreserved MS patients with depression [ 60]. Of note, these\\nabnormalities were also observed in MS patients with cognitive\\nimpairment, possibly reﬂecting a common pathophysiology leading\\nto an overlapping symptomatology (e.g., concentration and memory\\ndifﬁculties).\\nRecently, the potential contribution of HPA axis on depression in\\nMS patients has been explored with controversial results [61, 62].\\nProton magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed increased gluta-\\nmate levels in the hypothalamus of MS patients with depression,\\npossibly reﬂecting a metabolic involvement of this structure in\\ndepression-related processes [61]. Another study showed that MS-\\nrelated depression was associatedwith more distributed abnormal-\\nities involving the three explored monoaminergic networks (i.e.,\\ndopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin transporters), resulting in\\noverall reduced RS FC in the frontal lobe, limbic areas and the\\nprecuneus [62]. Conversely, no signiﬁcant associations between GM\\natrophy and atlas-based distribution of the main neurotransmitters\\n(i.e., serotonergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic, cholinergic and\\nglutamatergic maps) were found for depression in a recent study\\n[63]. These discrepancies may be related, at least partially, to the\\ndifferent methodologies applied (structural vs fMRI), as well as\\ndifferent MS populations investigated.\\nTherapeutic approaches . Diagnosis and treatment of mood\\ndisorders are fundamental to improve MS patient ’s daily-life\\nactivities, QoL, as well as therapeutic compliance and adherence.\\nTreatment of depression should be individualized and involve an\\nassociation between pharmacological and non-pharmacological\\ntreatments.\\nA Cochrane review, published in 2011 [64], selected only two\\ncontrolled double-blind randomized trials (RCTs). Desipramine (a\\ntricyclic antidepressant) at the highest dosage of 200 mg/day [65]\\nand paroxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) at a\\ndosage of up to 40 mg/day [66] were compared with placebo in\\n32 and 42 depressed-MS patients, respectively on a 5- and 12-\\nweek period. In both trials, a trend towards efﬁcacy was observed,\\nalthough not reaching statistical signiﬁcance.\\nIn the absence of newer RCTs or observational studies in MS,\\ntreatment should follow the same guidelines as for the general\\npopulation. First-line treatments of depression comprise serotonin\\nreuptake inhibitors, followed by serotonin-norepinephrine reup-\\ntake inhibitors, such as venlafaxine and duloxetine, tricyclic\\nantidepressants and mirtazapine [67].\\nPsychotherapy has long been considered an important treat-\\nment option for the management of depression in MS patients,\\nwith approaches focusing on coping skills showing superiority\\nover insight-oriented therapies [ 68]. In this view, cognitive\\nbehavior therapy can help maximize the development of the\\npatients’ coping skills [68]. The effectiveness of mindful-based\\nintervention which is based on the nonjudgmental awareness of\\neveryday moments has also been recently demonstrated [ 69].\\nHowever, these approaches cannot be used in cognitive impaired\\nMS patients [69].\\nRegarding non-pharmacological treatments, transcranial mag-\\nnetic stimulation is a recognized technique for the treatment of\\ncognitive and mood symptoms in depression [7].\\nAlthough no data are available for the treatment of MS\\ndepressive symptoms, by applying lesion network mapping, a\\nrecent study found that MS lesions associated with depression are\\nM.

This supports not only that\\nMS depression is associated with lesion location, but also that MS\\ndepression may share some neuroanatomical features with other\\ndepression etiologies and therapeutic neuromodulation sites.\\nThe association between disease modifying treatments (DMTs)\\nand mood disorders has been partially investigated. Early reports\\nsuggested an association between IFN-α, IFN-β and depression\\n[71]. While a randomized controlled trial comparing IFN-β and\\nglatiramer acetate showed no statistical differences between the\\ntwo treatment groups in terms of BDI scores [ 72], the EPOC\\n(Evaluate Patient Outcome) study showed that after switching\\nfrom injectable medications (i.e., IFN-β and glatiramer acetate) to\\nﬁngolimod BDI-II scores signi ﬁcantly reduced over a 6-month\\nperiod [73].\\nSome observational studies suggested a positive effect of\\nnatalizumab and ﬁngolimod on depression [74, 75], whereas the\\npossible interplay between depression and other DMTs such as\\ndimethyl fumarate, teriﬂunomide, alemtuzumab and ocrelizumab\\nhas not been studied yet.\\nAnxiety disorders\\nEpidemiological and clinical features. Anxiety disorders comprise\\nseparation anxiety and selective mutism, which occur primarily in\\nchildhood, speciﬁc phobias, social anxiety disorder, generalized\\nanxiety disorder, as well as panic disorder and agoraphobia,\\noccurring primarily in adulthood [76].\\nIndividuals with anxiety disorders are excessively fearful,\\nanxious, or avoidant of perceived threats in the environment or\\ninternal to oneself [77]. The response is out of proportion to the\\nactual risk or danger posed. Fear occurs because of perceived\\nimminent threat whereas anxiety is a state of anticipation about\\nperceived future threats. Panic attacks feature prominently as a\\nparticular type of fear response. Avoidance behaviors range from\\nrefusal to enter situations to subtle reliance on objects or people\\nto cope [77].\\nAnxiety disorders are common symptoms in MS, with an age-\\nstandardized prevalence reported up to 35.6% (95%\\nCI= 33.7–37.7%) of patients compared to 29.6% (95%\\nCI = 28.8–30.5%) in the general population [ 14]. MS patients\\nexperience anxiety disorders at some point during their lives,\\nhowever the prevalence peak is 45–59 years both in MS and in the\\ngeneral population [13, 14]. Anxiety disorders are often related to\\nfemale sex, a younger age [ 78], and a closer MS onset and\\ndiagnosis [79]. Indeed, MS diagnosis could be a risk factor to\\ndevelop anxiety disorders as the prevalence of self-reported\\nanxiety symptoms at time of MS onset is 2.7%, whereas it\\nbecomes 6.2% by the time of diagnosis [80].\\nSeveral studies investigated the association between anxiety\\nand cognitive functioning in MS [80–82], showing an association\\nbetween a worse performance on executive functioning, visual\\nmemory, and information processing speed and a higher level of\\nanxiety [81–83]. Moreover, MS patients with anxiety disorders\\nexperience signiﬁcantly more fatigue, pain and sleep problems,\\nwhich worsen with the co-occurrence of depression [84].\\nPathophysiology. The pathophysiology of anxiety disorders is\\npoorly understood in the general population, even less is known\\nin MS. In the general population, genetic-epidemiological studies\\nshowed a moderate familial aggregation for anxiety disorders,\\nwith heritability estimates in the range of 30–50% [85].\\nAs discussed below, several brain regions have been implicated\\nin the modulation of anxiety disorders both in general population\\nand MS, including amygdala, hippocampus and medial prefrontal\\ncortex (the ventromedial prefrontal and anterior cingulate\\ncortices). The involvement of hypothalamus, midbrain and\\nbrainstem has also been described.\\nAnxiety symptoms and the resulting disorders are thought to be\\ndue to disrupted modulation within the CNS. Several neurotrans-\\nmitter systems have been implicated to have a role in one or\\nseveral of the modulatory steps involved. A reduced activation of\\nthe serotonergic system and an over activation of the noradre-\\nnergic system have been described [86], resulting in dysregulation\\nof physiological arousal and the emotional experience of this\\narousal [86].\\nThe HPA axis has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of\\nanxiety disorders. Reduced ci rculating cortisol levels and\\nglucocorticoid hypersensitivi ty have been described in post-\\ntraumatic syndrome disorder [ 87]. Experimental studies have\\nalso showed that the HPA axis is hyperactivated in a wide range\\nof models of stress and anxiety [88]. In turn, these ﬁndings\\ns u p p o r tt h er o l eo fg l u c o c o r t i c o i d sa sc r u c i a lm e d i a t o r so f\\nfunctional and anatomical abnor malities observed in cortical\\nand limbic regions (acting through glucocorticoid and miner-\\nalocorticoid receptors) [89].\\nMRI ﬁndings. A few studies have investigated the association\\nbetween anxiety symptoms and measures of brain structural and\\nfunctional damage in MS patients with inconclusive results,\\nreﬂecting the complexity of the disease.\\nEarly studies showed no correlation between anxiety severity\\nscore and brain T2-hyperintense, T1-hypointense and gadolinium-\\nenhancing WM lesions [90–92]. Conversely, more recent evidence\\nrevealed that MS patients with fatigue and anxiety symptoms had\\nlarger caudate volumes and a thinner left parietal cortex\\ncompared to those without fatigue; another study showed that\\nMS-related anxiety may have its neuropathological substrate in\\nthe septo-fornical area [93]. The lack of de ﬁnite pathological\\nsubstrates leads to consider anxiety as a reactive response\\nfollowing disease progression [ 91]. However, a recent study\\nshowed that MS patients with higher anxiety severity score had\\nincreased atrophy in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, a crucial\\narea for top-down control for threat and emotional processing\\n[94], supporting a direct link between anxiety symptoms and\\nstructural damage [95].\\nAlthough anxiety has not been investigated in depth as\\ndepression in MS, several studies performed in people with\\ngeneralized anxiety disorder showed an involvement of speciﬁc\\nbrain regions. A large meta-analysis [ 96] revealed that only\\natrophy of the anterior cingulate and inferior frontal cortex was\\nassociated with anxiety symptoms in patients with anxiety\\ndisorders compared to healthy controls. Atrophy of the ventro-\\nmedial prefrontal cortex, a region associated with emotion and\\nreward in decision-making, has been also detected in patients\\nwith generalized anxiety disorders [97].\\nDiffusion tensor MRI studies also revealed widespread abnorm-\\nalities in regions involved in the generation and regulation of\\nemotion, such as amygdala [98], uncinate fasciculus and cingulum\\nin people with generalized anxiety disorder compared to healthy\\ncontrols [99, 100]. Notably, reduced fractional anisotropy values in\\nright uncinate fasciculus and left cingulum bundle showed\\nsigniﬁcantly negative correlations with anxiety severity score,\\nsupporting the involvement of these structures in anxiety\\ndisorders [100].\\nA recent RS FC study performed in MS patients identiﬁed an\\nanxiety-related network, compris ing bilateral prefrontal cortex,\\namygdala and hippocampus, which correlated to atrophy of the\\ndorsal pre-frontal cortex [95]. Interestingly, this network\\nresembles previously observed patterns of network-level dys-\\nfunction described for generalized anxiety disorders [101]. It is\\ntempting to speculate that the atrophy of the pre-frontal cortex\\nalters the functional connectivity to speci ﬁcb r a i na r e a s( i . e . ,\\namygdala and hippocampus) distal from the primary spot of\\natrophy leading to the loss of information input from a damaged\\npart of the brain [102].\\nM.

Indeed, so far, no controlled studies on\\nthe effectiveness of psychological or pharmacological treatments\\nof anxiety disorders were performed in MS patients, suggesting a\\nneed for research in this area. Only three clinical trials for\\ndepression evaluated the beneﬁcial effect of psychological\\ntreatment on MS-related anxiety, without showing any statistical\\nimprovement, probably due to the co-occurrence of depressive\\nsymptoms [104].\\nA few RCTs and observational studies evaluated the effect of\\nDMTs on anxiety symptoms. An improvement of anxiety\\nsymptoms was observed following both natalizumab and\\nﬁngolimod treatment, which was not statistically signi ﬁcant\\n[105–107].\\nCOGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT\\nEpidemiological and clinical features\\nCognitive impairment is a major cause of disability in MS with a\\nprevalence ranging between 34 and 91% according to the cohorts\\nof patients investigated, the neuropsychological tests used, and\\nthe criteria applied to deﬁne cognitive impairment, as explained\\nfurther below [108–111].\\nAlthough the pattern of cognitive de ﬁcits is highly variable\\namong MS patients, information processing speed, attention,\\nlearning, and memory are the most frequently involved domains,\\nwhereas deﬁcits in executive functions and visuospatial proces-\\nsing are also reported, but less frequently [2, 3, 32].\\nSex may in ﬂuence cognitive functions in MS [ 112–114].\\nCompared to females, male MS patients seem to be more\\nimpaired on several cognitive domains, including verbal memory,\\nexecutive functions, attention, memory, visuospatial processing,\\nand information processing speed [112–114].\\nCognitive impairment has been described in 20–25% of patients\\nwith clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 30–45% of patients with\\nrelapsing-remitting (RR) MS, and 50 –75% of patients with\\nsecondary progressive (SP) MS [115]. Although the prevalence of\\ncognitive impairment in primary progressive (PP) disease varies\\ngreatly, depending on the population considered, it occurs in up\\nto 91% of patients [108]. Cognitive dysfunction has been also\\ndescribed in subjects with a radiologically isolated syndrome [RIS]\\n[116], where MRIﬁndings suggestive of MS are incidentally found\\nin an asymptomatic subject. In particular, cognitive deﬁcits can\\nprecede the appearance of other neurological symptoms and\\nsigns and are associated inﬂammatory-demyelinating lesions of\\nthe CNS seen on MRI [109, 116]. Cognitive deﬁcits have been also\\nfound in more than 50% of patients with pediatric-onset MS, i.e., in\\nthose patients where the clinical onset of the disease occurs\\nbefore the age of 18 years. These patients are characterized by\\nworse performance in information processing speed and memory\\nas well as verbal intelligence compared to age-matched healthy\\ncontrols [117]. Decreased intelligence quotient and academic skills\\nhave also been described [118]. It is likely that inﬂammation of the\\nbrain during critical developmental periods [ 119], including\\nmyelinogenesis in adolescence, may irreparably damage neural\\nnetworks involved in such domains [120].\\nSeveral test batteries have been recommended and validated to\\nexplore cognitive performance in MS patients [121]. While the\\nmore lengthy and complex Brief Repeatable Battery-\\nNeuropsychology (BRB-N, 45 min) and MACFIMS (Minimal\\nAssessment of Cognitive Function in Multiple Sclerosis, 90 min)\\nare usually applied in research settings, a shorter assessment, such\\nas the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for multiple\\nsclerosis (BICAMS) [122], or the assessment of only information\\nprocessing speed using the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)\\n[123], may be more appropriate for clinical use (Table1). While\\nMACFIMS has a stronger psychometric foundation compared to\\nBRB-N and includes assessment of spatial processing and higher\\nexecutive function abilities, both tests provide information\\nregarding working memory, executive functions and verbal\\nﬂuency compared to BICAMS (Table1).\\nInterestingly, some longitudinal studies with a long follow-up\\nprovided important insights into the pattern of cognitive evolution in\\nMS. Two of these studies observed deterioration in simple and\\ncomplex auditory attention span and episodic verbal learning and\\nmemory, with one showing additional worsening in visuospatial\\nmemory, whereas the other found additional deterioration in\\ninformation processing speed and visual construction [124, 125].\\nThe third study showed signiﬁcant deterioration only in information\\nprocessing speed and complex attention [126].\\nRecently, the traditional dichotomous classiﬁcation of cognitive\\nfunctioning, namely, preserved vs impaired cognition, has been\\nchallenged. Indeed, by applying different methodologies, such as\\nmachine learning or more classiﬁcation-style approaches (e.g.,\\nInternational Classiﬁcation of Cognitive Disorders in Epilepsy; IC-\\nCoDE), recent studies have examined cognitive impairment in MS\\nby identifying distinctive cognitive phenotypes [127–130]. These\\nstudies identiﬁed from three to ﬁve phenotypes, highlighting a\\nspectrum of cognitive function ranging from intact to a multi-\\ndomain impairment [127–130]. Compared to the dichotomous\\nclassiﬁcation of cognitive impairment, the deﬁnition of speciﬁc\\ncognitive phenotypes may represent a step toward tailored\\ntreatment approaches and toward improving understanding of\\nthe different pathophysiological mechanisms related to cognitive\\nchanges in MS.\\nNotably, the revised ﬁfth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical\\nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) proposed a common framework\\nfor the diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders, including mild and\\nmajor neurocognitive disorders [131]. Brieﬂy, the DSM-5 diagnosis of\\nmajor neurocognitive disorder requires substantial impairment to be\\npresent in one or (usually) more cognitive domains, and this must be\\nsufﬁcient to interfere with independence in everyday activities. The\\ndiagnosis of mild neurocognitive disorder is made when there is\\nmodest impairment in one or more cognitive domains and the\\nindividual is still independent in everyday activities, albeit with\\ngreater effort.

Th is emphasizes the role of\\nadditional factors, including brain reserve and cognitive\\nreserve [3].\\nThe brain reserve hypothesis states that people with higher\\nbrain reserve withstand more severe disease burden before\\nexperiencing cognitive decline [132]. Brain reserve is attained\\nduring the critical period of the human development and refers\\nto structural characteristics (i.e., maximal lifetime brain growth)\\n[132]. Intracranial volume (ICV) is an estimate of maximal\\nlifetime brain growth, as brain growth corresponds to increased\\nICV during development [ 133]. MS patients with higher ICV\\nshowed better cognitive scoresin the SDMT and Paced Auditory\\nSerial Addition Task-3 (PASAT-3) measures compared to those\\nwith lower ICV [134]. Of note, this protective effect was speciﬁc\\nfor these cognitive domains and was not related to memory\\nfunctions [134].\\nThe cognitive reserve hypothesis [132, 134, 135] relies on the\\nevidence that daily-life activities and increased intellectual\\nenrichment, such as vocabulary, literacy, intelligence, education,\\nwork and engagement in cognitive enriching leisure activities,\\nmay mitigate the negative effect of disease-related structural\\ndamage on cognitive status, particularly memory abilities\\n[134, 136–139]. A protective effect was observed for life\\nexperience (i.e., early life cognitive leisure) and education,\\nindependently from ICV [134]. Different studies showed that both\\nRRMS [140, 141] and SPMS patients [142] with higher intellectual\\nenrichment were less likely to suffer disease-related cognitive\\nimpairment. Notably, the potential protective role of cognitive\\nreserve against cognitive dysfunction was also evident in pediatric\\nMS [143]. In these patients, higher intelligence quotient scores\\nwere associated with stable or improved cognitive performance at\\nsubsequent evaluations, particularly in cognitively-preserved\\nsubjects at theﬁrst assessment [ 143]. These positive effects\\nappeared to be maintained during adulthood [144, 145]. There-\\nfore, cognitive reserve could be particularly efﬁcient in children,\\nwho may have greater capacity to compensate from brain\\ndamage through neural plasticity.\\nIn this view, cognitive impairment is more prevalent in older MS\\npatients compared to younger patients [146]. Some evidence also\\nsuggested that male patients had more vulnerability to cognitive\\ndeﬁcits compared to female patients in MS [147].\\nSince cognitive reserve is potentially a modiﬁable factor, its\\nenhancement through physical exercise, mentally active lifestyles,\\nmanagement of cardiovascular risk factors and other comorbid-\\nities, might be a therapeutic target to prevent or slow cognitive\\ndeterioration in MS patients [148].\\nFig. 1 Schematic representation of the main substrates underlying cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis.WM and GM damage (i.e.,\\nfocal lesions and subtle abnormalities in normal-appearing brain tissues), and functional abnormalities, especially in strategic regions, can\\nexplain the presence and severity of cognitive impairment.

Disconnection mechanisms have been\\nsuggested to contribute to cognitive impairment in MS patients,\\nthrough the disruption of integration between different cogni-\\ntively relevant brain regions [3].\\nConsistently with this hypoth esis, correlative clinical–lesional\\nstudies have demonstrated that brain T2-hyperintense WM LV and\\nthe location of lesions in cognitively-relevant WM tracts or regions\\nhelp to explain global cognitive dysfunction as well as deﬁcits in\\nspeciﬁc cognitive domains in MS patients [3, 149, 150]. A structural\\nconnectivity disruption was observed in RRMS patients within visual\\nnetwork, between visual and deep GM networks, and between\\ndefault mode and frontoparietal networks, and correlated with worse\\nworking memory [151]. In another study, a close correlation between\\nlower information processing speedand higher structural disconnec-\\ntion in the default mode network was found in RRMS patients with\\nand without cognitive impairment, being more pronounced in the\\nformer group [152]. Worse executive control in RRMS patients\\ncorrelated with higher structural disconnection in the frontoparietal\\nnetworks, deep GM structures and insula [ 153], and within\\nsensorimotor, dorsal attention, left frontoparietal, and default mode\\nnetworks [154].\\nMoreover, the severity of lesional microstructural abnormalities in\\nWM tracts that are critical for cognitive functions, such as the\\ncingulum, were also found to be relevant predictors of global\\ncognitive impairment and of deﬁcits in single cognitive domains\\n[155].\\nIn addition to focal WM lesions, diffuse NAWM damage may also\\nundermine the physiological co nnections among cognitively-\\nrelevant GM regions, contributing to a disconnection syndrome.\\nUsing diffusion tensor MRI, performance at global cognitive functions\\nand at speciﬁc cognitive domains, including information processing\\nspeed, attention, memory, verbalﬂuency and executive functions,\\nhave been consistently found to be associated with microstructural\\nabnormalities in relevant WM tracts, such as the corpus callosum,\\ncingulum, fornix and thalamic connections [155–166]. Interestingly,\\nthese abnormalities partially overlapped with brain T2-hyperintense\\nWM lesions, supporting an independent role of NAWM damage in\\ndetermining cognitive impairment [162, 163, 165].\\nFocal and diffuse GM damage has been consistently identiﬁed\\namong the best predictors of cognitive de ﬁcits. Using double\\ninversion recovery (DIR) sequence, higher number and volume of\\ncortical lesions, especially in the hippocampus, were found to be\\nsigniﬁcantly associated with the severity of cognitive dysfunction\\n[167–169] and to predict worsening of cognitive performance over 5\\nyears [170]. Moreover, more severe atrophy and microstructural\\nabnormalities of cognitively-relevant GM regions such as the\\nthalamus, hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum have been consis-\\ntently identiﬁed among the best contributors of worse cognitive\\nperformance in MS patients wit h the main disease clinical\\nphenotypes [171–176], and to predict cognitive deterioration over\\nup to 13 years [177, 178].\\nA few studies have analyzed the relationship between distinct\\ncognitive deﬁcits (e.g., memory or visuospatial impairment) and\\nregional cortical atrophy in MS. These studies usually included\\nrelatively small samples or focused on speciﬁc tests or brain regions,\\nwith conﬂicting results. While a study showed no signi ﬁcant\\ncorrelation between SDMT and regional brain volumes [179], more\\nrecent studies revealed an assoc iation with prefrontal cortex,\\nprecentral and postcentral gyri, and right temporal cortex [180]a s\\nwell as thalamus, cerebellum, putamen, and occipital cortex [181].\\nSo far, a few studies have investigated the differences of structural\\nbrain damage between males and female MS patients in cognitive\\nimpairment. Some studies suggested that more severe NAWM\\nmicrostructural abnormalities [112] and subcortical GM atrophy [113]\\nin male compared to female MS patients are two relevant\\npathological substrates contributing to sex-related differences in\\ncognitive impairment in MS. In a recent study [182], worse cognitive\\nperformance seemed to be associated mainly with deep GM volume\\nloss in female MS patients, and with cortical GM volume loss in male\\nMS patients.\\nFunctional brain MRI. Beside structural damage, fMRI studies may\\nprovide relevant pieces of information about the substrates\\nunderpinning cognitive impairment. MS patients without cogni-\\ntive impairment have consistently shown increased and more\\nwidely distributed cortical recruitment than healthy controls\\nduring the performance of cognitive tasks [158, 183, 184]. These\\nfunctional abnormalities are associated with measures of brain\\nstructural damage (i.e., brain T2-hyperintense WM LV, NAWM and\\nGM damage) [158] and suggest that the increased activation\\nduring a task of crucial cortical regions/networks might represent\\nadaptive processes able to attenuate the negative effect of MS-\\nrelated tissue damage on cognitive function. However, such\\nincreased cortical recruitment cannot persist indeﬁnitely, and the\\nloss or exhaustion of adaptive mechanisms might contribute to\\ncognitive decline [185–187].\\nAnother mechanism that has been disclosed in MS patients\\nwhen applying active fMRI tasks is the inability to optimize\\ncognitive network recruitment with increasing task dif ﬁculty,\\nwhich results from an impaired functional reserve (the ability to\\nmatch brain activity to increasing cognitive demand) [188, 189].\\nThis maladaptive mechanism contributes to the clinical\\nmanifestations of the disease, is more pronounced in patients\\nwith SPMS [189] and in those with cognitive impairment [190].\\nThe network compensation-c ollapse hypothesis has been\\nproven also using an analysis of RS FC. In the earliest phases of\\nthe disease and in MS patients without cognitive impairment,\\nbetter cognitive performance was associated with increased RS\\nFC among several regions of several brain networks, such as the\\nattention network [191, 192]. On the other hand, in MS patients\\nwith cognitive impairment, more heterogeneous and inefﬁcient\\npatterns of RS FC abnormalities have been found. Indeed,\\nreduced RS FC of anterior regions of the brain, mostly located in\\nthe frontal lobes [ 193, 194], associated with more severe\\ncognitive impairment and with structural disruption of the\\nconnecting WM tracts [193], but also increased RS FC associated\\nwith worse cognitive performance [195, 196].\\nCognitive functions are complex brain processes based on\\nlocal processing and effective integration among different\\nregions. Accordingly, pathological processes can determine\\ncognitive dysfunction throug had i r e c ti n v o l v e m e n to fG M\\nregions relevant for cognitive fu nctions and the disruption of\\ntheir connections. Consistentl y with this hypothesis, multi-\\nparametric MRI studies have fu rther supported a complimen-\\ntary and independent contribution of focal WM lesions, NAWM\\nmicrostructural damage and G M atrophy, combined with\\nfunctional brain network abnormalities, to cognitive impair-\\nment in MS patients [164, 165, 197–200]. At present, only two\\nlongitudinal studies [ 187, 201] have employed both structural\\nand functional MRI techniques, ﬁnding an association between\\ncortical [201] and deep GM atrophy, maladaptive excessive and\\ninefﬁcient recruitment of brain networks and worse cognitive\\nperformances over time [187, 201].\\nRecent work also pointed out an involvement of speci ﬁc\\nneurotransmitter systems to explain cognitive impairment in\\nMS patients. In line with this, compared to cognitively\\npreserved MS patients, those with cognitive impairment\\nshowed signiﬁcant GM atrophy that was spatially correlated\\nwith a higher atlas-based distribution of speci ﬁcr e c e p t o ro r\\ntransporter of dopamine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine and\\nglutamate. Although these studies did not directly explore the\\nimpairment of speciﬁc neurotransmitters networks, these\\nresults suggested that cognitive impairment may be associated\\nwith a pattern of GM atrophy that is not random and involves\\nregions with a high and speciﬁc distribution of\\nM.

Notably, such beneﬁcial effects\\nmay occur also in MS patients with a progressive disease course\\nand more severe cognitive impairment, suggesting that, beyond\\ntheir effect in reducing disease activity, DMTs can improve or, at\\nleast stabilize, cognitive functions [202].\\nCognitive rehabilitation [203–205] and symptomatic treatments\\n[206] may also contribute to preserve and improve cognitive\\nfunctions in MS patients.\\nCognitive rehabilitation typically refers to training targeting\\nimprovement of skill by regaining (re-establishing or strengthen-\\ning) abilities that were intact prior to the loss. The other focus of\\ncognitive rehabilitation is developing compensatory strategies for\\nlost abilities when they cannot be regained. In contrast, the term\\ncognitive intervention refers to targeted training of a particular\\ncognitive skill or domain for the purpose of enhancement\\nregardless of the baseline state of cognitive abilities [ 203].\\nHistorically, most of the measures implemented for use involved\\nlearning and memory-based interventions, but recently the focus\\nhas moved to executive function and attention, since these are\\nthe cognitive domains most affected in MS [203].\\nConﬂicting ﬁndings about the effectiveness of the various\\ncognitive rehabilitation techniques exist and therefore no deﬁnite\\nconclusions can be drawn about their effect on cognition. Two\\nCochrane reviews assessing 20 randomized controlled trials of\\nbehavioral interventions [205] and 15 interventional trials pointed\\nout the low bene ﬁcial effects of rehabilitation on cognitive\\nfunctioning. A separate systematic review evaluating 33 original\\nintervention studies supported similar conclusions [203]. However,\\nthese ﬁndings may be limited by the evaluation of small samples\\nof subjects or methodological biases; thus, future research should\\nbe devoted to better understating the potential beneﬁts of such\\ntherapies. It is worth mentioning that a randomized clinical trial\\nwith a combined approach of cognitive rehabilitation and aerobic\\nexercise is ongoing [207].\\nSimilarly, at present there is insufﬁcient evidence to support the\\nuse of symptomatic pharmacologic treatments (i.e., donepezil,\\nrivastigmine, memantine) to improve cognitive function in people\\nwith MS [206, 208].\\nHowever, a multiparametric combined approach including\\nDMTs, symptomatic therapies, rehabilitation together with the\\nadoption of a healthy lifestyle (i.e., physical exercise, mental\\nactivity, prevention of cardiovascular disease and other comorbid-\\nities, smoking cessation, etc.) may be the most rewarding strategy\\nto preserve cognitive integrity and to recover cognitive functions\\nin MS patients showing cognitive deﬁcits [148].\\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms are frequently reported in MS\\npatients. Among them, cognitive impairment, clinical depression\\nand anxiety are the most common with a higher frequency in MS\\npatients compared to the general population [4]. These symptoms\\nmay develop even before the diagnosis of MS [209], and, hence,\\nearly diagnosis is crucial to prevent complications. Although an\\nimproved understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms\\nunderlying these conditions has led to the development of several\\nneuropsychological batteries and scales to better identify these\\nsymptoms, deﬁnite treatment guidelines still not exist in MS.\\nFurther studies are needed to clarify the complex interplay\\nbetween MS and neuropsychiatric disorders, especially the\\ninﬂuence of factors such as sex, lesion location, involvement of\\nneuroendocrine factors and possible side effects related to DMTs.\\nFinally, larger RCTs may shed light on the effectiveness of\\npharmacological therapy and psychotherapy in MS patients with\\nneuropsychiatric symptoms.\\nREFERENCES\\n1.

The incidence of MS is increasing worldwide, together\\nwith the socioeconomic impact of the disease. The underlying cause of MS\\nand mechanisms behind this increase remain opaque, although complex gene–\\nenvironment interactions almost certainly play a signiﬁcant role. The epidemi-\\nology of MS indicates that low serum levels of vitamin D, smoking, childhood\\nobesity and infection with the Epstein–Barr virus are likely to play a role in\\ndisease development. Changes in diagnostic methods and criteria mean that\\npeople with MS can be diagnosed increasingly early in their disease trajectory.\\nAlongside this, treatments for MS have increased exponentially in number,\\neﬃcacy and risk. There is now the possibility of a diagnosis of ‘pre-sympto-\\nmatic MS’ being made; as a result potentially preventive strategies could be\\nstudied. In this comprehensive review, MS epidemiology, potential aetiological\\nfactors and pathology are discussed, before moving on to clinical aspects of\\nMS diagnosis and management.\\nIntroduction\\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is the commonest non-trau-\\nmatic disabling disease to aﬀect young adults [1].\\nThere is increasing incidence and prevalence of MS in\\nboth developed and developing countries [2], the\\nunderlying cause of which remains uncertain. MS is a\\ncomplex disease; many genes modestly increase disease\\nsusceptibility in addition to several well deﬁned envi-\\nronmental factors, in particular vitamin D or ultravio-\\nlet B light (UVB) exposure, Epstein –Barr virus (EBV)\\ninfection, obesity and smoking [3].\\nMultiple sclerosis has historically been classiﬁed as\\nan organ-speciﬁc T-cell mediated autoimmune disease.\\nHowever, the success of B-cell targeted therapies chal-\\nlenges the standard T-cell autoimmune dogma [4]. It\\nis traditionally viewed as a two-stage disease, with\\nearly inﬂammation responsible for relapsing–remitting\\ndisease and delayed neurodegeneration causing non-\\nrelapsing progression, i.e. secondary and primary\\nprogressive MS [5,6].\\nThe emergence of increasingly eﬀective biological\\ntherapies and an active approach to treating MS, in\\nparticular treating to a target of no evident disease\\nactivity (NEDA), are changing the long-term outcome\\nfor people with MS (pwMS). More aggressive immune\\nreconstitution therapies, that result in a proportion of\\npwMS entering long-term remission, oﬀer a small\\nnumber of pwMS a potential cure [7]. Recent positive\\ntrials of disease-modifying therapies in progressive MS\\noﬀer those with more advanced MS the hope of slow-\\ning their disease progression, with preservation of\\nresidual function [8]. The fact that treatments appear\\nto work at multiple stages in the disease course signiﬁ-\\ncantly challenges the traditional two-stage view of the\\nnatural history of MS [9].\\nEpidemiology and aetiology\\nIt is often stated that the cause of MS is unknown;\\nhowever, this is not quite correct. EBV, sunshine\\n(UVB), smoking and vitamin D, combined with an\\nindividual’s genetic background, play important roles\\nin the causal pathway that results in MS development\\n[10]. Migration studies consistently support MS being\\nsecondary to an environmental exposure [11]. Adult\\nCorrespondence: R.

Migration studies indicate that environment\\ntrumps genetics and argue strongly for prevention\\nstudies targeting known environmental risk factors.\\nBeing truly EBV negative protects from developing\\nMS [12,13]; symptomatic EBV infection (i.e. infectious\\nmononucleosis) doubles the chances of getting MS\\n[14]. Evidence regarding the mechanism via which\\nEBV increases MS risk is heterogeneous; molecular\\nmimicry is historically a popular theory [15]. More\\nrecently EBV-induced B-cell immortalization and/or\\ntransformation has been thought to play an important\\nrole in disease development [16].\\nMultiple sclerosis is increasingly a global disease [2].\\nMS prevalence increases with latitude; however, this\\ngradient is decreasing in Norway and the USA, the\\ntwo countries where it has been studied [17]. The lati-\\ntudinal gradient in MS prevalence is strongly corre-\\nlated with UVB exposure, which stimulates cutaneous\\nvitamin D (vD) production. Low vD levels, decreased\\nintake of vD, reduced outdoor activity and increased\\nMS susceptibility associated with genetic polymor-\\nphisms causing low vD levels have implicated vD in\\nthe causal pathway of MS [18].\\nMultiple sclerosis is more common in females, but\\nthis has not always been the case. In case series from\\nthe early 1900s the sex ratio was almost equal. Since\\nthen, the sex ratio has steadily been increasing and it\\nis now close to 3:1 (F:M) in most developed countries\\n[19]. Smoking, which increases MS risk by approxi-\\nmately 50%, can explain up to 40% of the increased\\nincidence of MS in women [20]. Prior to the Second\\nWorld War, few women smoked, but the number of\\nwomen smoking rapidly increased post-war, mirroring\\nthe increasing incidence of MS in women [20]. The\\nobservation that organic solvents [21] and smoked\\ntobacco [22], but not oral tobacco or snuﬀ [23], are\\nassociated with MS has led to the hypothesis that\\nthese agents cause post-translational modiﬁcations via\\nantigen presentation occurring in the lungs.\\nIt is likely that MS risk modiﬁcation occurs\\nthroughout life, starting in utero [10]. The month-of-\\nbirth eﬀect and increased concordance in dizygotic\\ntwins compared to siblings indicates that the intrauter-\\nine environment is important in establishing MS risk;\\nit is unclear whether this is due to common environ-\\nmental exposures, or epigenetic mechanisms, or both\\n[10]. There is a genetic inﬂuence on MS susceptibility;\\nabout one in eight patients have a family history of\\nMS [24]. Concordance in female monozygotic twins\\napproaches 30% in the UK and Canada, but is as low\\nas~8.5% in southern Europe [25].\\nThe main genetic risk associated with MS resides in\\nHLA-DRB1*15 and/or other loci in strong linkage\\ndisequilibrium with this allele [26]. Heterozygotes for\\nHLA-DRB1*15:01 have an odds ratio of MS >3 and\\nhomozygotes >6 [26], yet the mechanism remains\\nunknown. It is hypothesized that HLA-DRB1 *15:01’s\\nrole is via antigen presentation; however, this does\\nnot explain the protective eﬀects of class 1 alleles (e.g.\\nHLA-A*02:01) [27].\\nGenome-wide association studies have identiﬁed\\nmore than 150 single nucleotide polymorphisms associ-\\nated with MS susceptibility [28]. The odds ratio associ-\\nated with the majority of these is small, around 1.1–1.2.\\nMany of these single nucleotide polymorphisms lie\\nclose to genes associated with immune function, typi-\\ncally in regulatory rather than coding regions. Func-\\ntional variants identiﬁed include those within IL7R\\n[29], IL2RA [30], TNFR1 [31], BAFF [32] and CYP2R1\\n[33]. Mendelian randomization studies have provided\\nevidence for a role of vitamin D [33–35] and obesity\\n[36] as independent risk factors causing disease.\\nRecent work has uncovered genetic diﬀerences\\nbetween relapsing –remitting MS (RRMS) and primary\\nprogressive MS (PPMS) [37] not previously detected in\\ngenome-wide association studies, most probably due to\\nthe under-representation of PPMS in these cohorts.\\nGenetic variants associated with other progressive neu-\\nrological disorders are relatively over-represented in\\nprogressive MS [37]. Similar genetic risk exists when all\\nMS-associated alleles are taken into account, indicating\\nadditional risk for progressive disease superimposed on\\nunderlying genetic susceptibility. Evidence of diﬀeren-\\ntial gene transcription between RRMS and PPMS [38]\\nagain hints at individual diﬀerences on a background of\\nshared genetic risk.\\nPathology and immunology\\nIn Charcot’s original descriptions of the pathology\\nassociated withscl/C19erose en plaques, he described ‘scle-\\nrosed plaques’ aﬀecting the periventricular area, pons\\nand spinal cord [39]. The characteristic pathological\\nhallmark of MS is perivenular inﬂammatory lesions,\\nleading to demyelinating plaques [40]. The inﬂamma-\\ntory inﬁltrates contain T-lymphocytes, dominated by\\nMHC class I restricted CD8+ T-cells; B-cells and\\nplasma cells are also present, although in much lower\\nnumbers [41]. Oligodendrocyte damage and demyeli-\\nnation occur as a result of inﬂammation. Axons are\\nrelatively preserved in the early stages of the disease;\\nhowever, as disease progresses irreversible axonal\\ndamage develops [42].

The composition of the\\ninﬂammatory inﬁltrate in relapsing –remitting and\\nprogressive MS is similar, although the proportion of\\nB-cells and plasma cells is higher in progressive MS\\n[44]. Whether the cytokine proﬁle or activation stage\\nof T-cells and B-cells diﬀers between clinical disease\\ntypes remains unclear [41].\\nRemyelination is seen in all disease stages, most\\ncommonly in progressive disease [41]. Patients with\\nsecondary progressive MS have higher levels of\\ndemyelination and a reduction in axonal density in\\nthe normal appearing white matter in the cervical\\nspinal cord in PPMS [45]. There is no single charac-\\nteristic histological diﬀerence between MS subtypes,\\nbut instead a diﬀerence in the proportion of areas\\nshowing particular characteristics. Thus, whilst three\\nclinical forms of MS have been deﬁned, the pathologi-\\ncal changes form a continuum. This ﬁts with gradual\\nclinical disease evolution in patients, from RRMS to\\nsecondary progressive MS over a period of years.\\nClinical features\\nMultiple sclerosis is a journey from being at risk,\\nthrough the asymptomatic, prodromal and symp-\\ntomatic phases of the disease. MS is typically sus-\\npected when a person presents with a clinically\\nisolated syndrome (CIS). This can be mono- or poly-\\nsymptomatic depending on the location of the\\neloquent lesion(s). The most commonly seen presenta-\\ntions are optic neuritis, brainstem and spinal cord syn-\\ndromes; however, numerous other less common\\npresentations exist, including cortical presentations\\nsuch as dominant parietal lobe syndromes.\\nMultiple sclerosis relapses usually develop suba-\\ncutely over hours to days, reach a plateau lasting sev-\\neral weeks, and then gradually recover. Gross clinical\\nrecovery from relapses often appears complete in early\\nMS; however, most relapses leave behind some dam-\\nage. For example, following acute optic neuritis gross\\nvisual acuity may recover but colour vision, contrast\\nsensitivity and depth perception abnormalities persist.\\nAs neuronal reserve is lost, recovery from relapses\\nbecomes incomplete, and neurological deﬁcits accrue\\nleading to sustained disability.\\nFor every clinical attack, approximately 10 ‘asymp-\\ntomatic’ lesions are noted on magnetic resonance\\nimaging (MRI). Symptomatology results from a\\ncombination of location and size – a small lesion in\\nan eloquent area is likely to cause symptoms. Macro-\\nscopic, or MRI-visible, lesions are the tip of the ice-\\nberg; many more lesions can be seen at microscopic\\nlevel and even more in deep and cortical grey matter.\\nSecondary progressive MS typically develops 10 –\\n15 years after RRMS onset, with a gradual evolution\\nfrom discrete relapses to slowly progressive disease.\\nThere is not a distinct transition between disease\\ntypes; rather, relapses occur on a background of sub-\\ntle progression, prior to progression being dominant.\\nThe cognitive impairment and progressive MRI atro-\\nphy seen in early MS indicate that neurodegeneration\\nis present from clinical onset.\\nIn 5% –15% of cases there is a primary progressive\\nonset (PPMS), typically with gradual accrual of pro-\\ngressive disability involving one dominant neuronal\\nsystem. The commonest presentation is with a pro-\\ngressive spastic paraparesis, but sensory ataxia, cere-\\nbellar ataxia and cognitive and progressive visual\\nfailure are well-described PPMS variants.\\nThere has been a reduction in the proportion of\\npeople with PPMS [46]. This is probably related to\\nthe fact that there are no licensed treatments for\\nPPMS; patients may be labelled as having relapsing\\nMS in order to receive treatment, raising ethical ques-\\ntions about the division of MS into distinct subtypes.\\nThis artiﬁcial division of MS into diﬀerent diseases\\nwas driven by the pharmaceutical industry to get\\ninterferon beta licensed under the Orphan Drug Act\\nin the USA.\\nPaediatric MS is considerably rarer than adult onset\\ndisease, with a highest reported incidence of 2.9/\\n100 000 [47]. The diagnosis is based on repeated epi-\\nsodes of demyelination separated by time and space.\\nDiﬀerentiating paediatric MS from acute disseminated\\nencephalomyelitis can be challenging, as paediatric\\nMS may be multifocal at onset [47]. Relapse rates\\nmay be higher, but physical recovery tends to be more\\ncomplete. Few treatments are licensed for use in chil-\\ndren, and referral to a paediatric neurologist with\\nexpertise in demyelinating disorders is recommended\\nwhere the diagnosis is suspected.\\nGiven the above, MS can be thought of as a single\\ndisease existing within a spectrum extending from\\nrelapsing (‘inﬂammatory dominant’) to progressive\\n(‘neurodegeneration dominant’), in keeping with the\\n2013 revisions to the clinical course of MS [48]. At\\npresent, MS deﬁnitions place artiﬁcial distinctions\\nbetween patients with progressive and patients with\\nrelapsing disease. Instead, these subtypes should be\\nseen as points on a continuum of disease, which\\nshould be expanded to include prodromal (i.e. radio-\\nlogically isolated) disease.\\n© 2018 EAN\\nMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS 29\\n 14681331, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ene.13819 by Azienda Usl Bologna, Wiley Online Library on [07/08/2024].

Migration studies\\nindicate that the time from exposure to environmental\\nrisk factors and the onset of disease is 10 –20 years\\n[49]. Pathological studies indicate that the preclinical\\nphase of MS could be decades; a Danish series found\\nthat a quarter of cases with postmortem pathological\\nevidence of MS were never diagnosed with MS in life\\n[50].\\nMultiple sclerosis begins before the ﬁrst clinical\\nattack; most patients presenting with a CIS have\\nolder, inactive, lesions on their MRI. Radiologically\\nisolated syndrome (RIS), or asymptomatic MS, is\\ndetected on an MRI done for unrelated reasons, such\\nas headache, head injury or screening in the airline\\nindustry. Even in these earliest stages there is evidence\\nof end-organ damage. MRI in young people with CIS\\nshows brain volume loss compared to controls [51].\\nSchool performance in children who later develop MS\\nis poorer than their peers [52], and a quarter of\\npatients with RIS have signiﬁcant cognitive impair-\\nment with a proﬁle similar to patients with established\\nMS [53]. This appears to indicate that not only is\\ninﬂammation present prior to diagnosis, but there is\\naccompanying neurodegeneration from the start.\\nIt is predicted that MS has the potential to become\\na model neurodegenerative disease, setting the stage\\nfor pre-symptomatic diagnosis for other neurodegen-\\nerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer’s and Parkin-\\nson’s disease. The big question is whether society is\\nready for population screening and pre-symptomatic\\ndiagnosis. At some point in time it is going to be nec-\\nessary to accept that, to have a meaningful impact on\\nthe burden associated with neurodegenerative disease,\\nthese conditions are going to have to be diagnosed in\\nthe pre-symptomatic phase.\\nImportant differential diagnoses\\nTable 1 lists the most common MS diﬀerential diag-\\nnoses or mimics. Red ﬂags include a ﬁrst relapse at an\\nolder age, where vascular disease is more likely. Non-\\nspeciﬁc white matter lesions may be seen in patients\\nwith no objective persisting neurological disability and\\nhistory of migraine, although migraine is more com-\\nmon in the MS population [54]. In those from low\\nprevalence areas and/or ethnic minorities, diﬀerential\\ndiagnoses must be carefully considered, as neurosar-\\ncoidosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and\\ninfections such as tuberculosis are more likely, and\\nMS-speciﬁc disease-modifying therapy may cause a\\nworsening of these diseases.\\nAnother red ﬂag is comorbid systemic symptoms\\nand signs; this should alert clinicians to exclude multi-\\nsystem diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus,\\nSj€ogren’s, Behc/C223et’s, Susac’s and other vasculitides. MS\\ncan coexist with other autoimmune diseases, and so\\nthe presence of these does not necessarily exclude MS,\\nand the overall clinical picture must be carefully\\nconsidered.\\nA diagnostic lumbar puncture is advised in all\\npatients presenting with possible MS. Cerebral spinal\\nﬂuid (CSF) analysis is helpful in both identifying MS\\nmimics and either supporting or arguing against a\\ndiagnosis of MS. Central nervous system (CNS) syn-\\nthesis of oligoclonal immunoglobulin G bands or\\noligoclonal bands (OCBs) can now be used to estab-\\nlish dissemination in time; it is hoped that this will\\nlead to a renaissance in the use of CSF for diagnostic,\\nprognostic and treatment response purposes.\\nInvestigations\\nThe diagnosis of MS remains clinical. However, treat-\\nable mimics should be excluded using paraclinical\\ninvestigations where indicated. All patients with sus-\\npected MS should have a lumbar puncture to help sup-\\nport the clinical diagnosis of MS, exclude MS mimics\\nand to help establish a baseline prognostic proﬁle.\\nSerological investigations\\nA standard baseline proﬁle should include anti-nuclear\\nantibody, vitamin B12 and thyroid function. Syphilis\\nand human immunodeﬁciency virus 1 serology are rec-\\nommended. Depending on the clinical presentation\\nhuman T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 and 2 serology,\\nanti-aquaporin-4 and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte gly-\\ncoprotein antibody screening may be indicated.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging\\nAll patients should undergo MRI imaging of at least\\nthe brain and, if the presentation is spinal, imaging\\nshould include the spinal cord. Imaging has a dual\\npurpose– it can help to conﬁrm the diagnosis by\\ndemonstrating dissemination in both time and space,\\nbut it can also exclude MS mimics when interpreted\\nby an experienced neuroradiologist. Approximately\\n2% of non-MS-related abnormalities picked up on\\nMRI are incidental ﬁndings, e.g. pituitary adenomas,\\npineal cysts, vascular malformations, benign menin-\\ngiomas and prolapsed intervertebral discs. These inci-\\ndental ﬁndings may clinically complicate things but\\nshould not distract from diagnosing MS. Visual, audi-\\ntory and sensory evoked potentials and central motor\\n© 2018 EAN\\n30 R.

Traditionally,\\nlesion accrual/count together with ‘active’ lesions\\n(gadolinium-enhancing) has been used to estimate dis-\\nease activity; however, correlation with long-term out-\\ncomes is imperfect. The importance of brain atrophy\\nseen on volumetric MRI is increasingly realized, as\\nwhen taken alongside lesion load there is good corre-\\nlation with long-term clinical outcomes [57].\\nHigh ﬁeld and double inversion MRI techniques\\nhave enabled the visualization of cortical MS lesions,\\nthe presence and number of which appear to correlate\\nwith clinical outcomes, most notably cognitive impair-\\nment [58]. Newer MRI techniques, including magneti-\\nzation transfer imaging, diﬀusion tensor imaging and\\nfunctional MRI are providing insights into disease\\nwith widespread abnormalities outside of focal lesion\\ndevelopment [59]; however, these techniques are not\\nyet in routine clinical practice.\\nTreatment and management of MS\\nThe treatment of MS can be divided into disease-mod-\\nifying therapies that tend to be MS-speciﬁc and symp-\\ntomatic therapies that are often used in diﬀerent\\ndisease areas to treat symptoms resulting from neuro-\\nlogical dysfunction.\\nDisease-modifying therapies\\nAs the number, and eﬃcacy, of disease-modifying\\ntherapies has increased, interest in early treatment of\\nMS in order to prevent long-term disability has\\ngrown. Historically, treatments have been immuno-\\nsuppressant (including ﬁngolimod, natalizumab, ocre-\\nlizumab) or immunomodulatory (such as interferon\\nbeta, glatiramer acetate, teriﬂunomide), meaning that\\nongoing treatment is required to maintain suppression\\nof inﬂammation (and disease activity). Immune recon-\\nstitution therapies (including alemtuzumab and\\ncladribine) can be given as short courses with the aim\\nof producing enduring immunological actions– this is\\nat present the closest to a potential cure for MS. This\\nraises the question as to whether early, or even pre-\\nsymptomatic, treatment can prevent clinically appar-\\nent disease (Figs 1 and 2, Table 3).\\nA recent concept in the treatment of MS is ‘no evi-\\ndence of disease activity’, or NEDA. This has developed\\nfrom the understanding that clinical relapses are only\\nthe tip of the iceberg in terms of MS disease activity.\\nOngoing inﬂammatory MRI activity occurs in excess of\\nclinical relapses; in addition, brain atrophy can progress\\nin the absence of overt inﬂammatory disease activity.\\nNEDA is deﬁned by clinical parameters (NEDA-1 and -\\n2– absence of relapses and clinical disease progression),\\ninﬂammatory MRI activity (NEDA-3) and MRI atro-\\nphy and biomarkers (NEDA-4 and -5 – CSF neuroﬁla-\\nment levels). In clinical practice, this has led to treatment\\nescalation earlier in disease, or early treatment with\\nhighly active therapies as ﬁrst line (Figs 1b and 3).\\nGiven that MS is most commonly diagnosed in\\nyoung women, pregnancy and family planning are real\\nconcerns for women with MS. Current evidence sug-\\ngests that pregnancy does not increase the risk of long-\\nterm disability in MS. However, it is also important\\nthat disease-modifying treatment is not unduly delayed,\\nespecially in those with active disease.

In general terms, these treatments\\nare not MS-speciﬁc. They include anticholinergics for\\nbladder dysfunction (which may contribute to cognitive\\nimpairment, necessitating an individualized approach)\\nand medication for neuropathic pain (typically tricyclic\\nantidepressants, or gabapentin and derivatives). Treating\\ncognitive impairment in MS is complex and centres\\naround the avoidance of possible contributors. Several\\nsymptomatic therapies have been licensed speciﬁcally for\\nMS. These include sativex for spasticity and fampridine\\nfor walking diﬃculties. An important aspect related to\\nsymptomatic therapies is sleep. The prevalence of diﬃ-\\nculties with sleeping increases as MS disease duration\\nincreases, and anxiety, depression and fatigue are more\\ncommon in those reporting poor sleep [61]. A detailed\\nreview of these is beyond the scope of this paper.\\nTreatment of comorbidities contributing to long-term\\ndisability\\nMultiple sclerosis reduces the brain and cognitive\\nreserve that delays the onset of age-related neurode-\\ngenerative disorders in later life.

Recurrent infec-\\ntions such as urinary tract infections may not only\\nresult in transient worsening of MS-related symptoms\\nbut could upregulate mechanisms known to speed up\\nworsening disability.\\nAlthough the evidence supporting lifestyle and well-\\nness modiﬁcations in MS is weak, the value of these\\nfor general health is important.

To this end, such patients exhibit \\ndisability progression despite being relapse-free \\nand exhibiting neither contrast-enhancing \\nT1-weighted (T1w) lesions nor new or enlarging \\nT2-weighted (T2w) lesions on magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI). This is often referred to as \\nprogression independent of relapse activity \\n(PIRA) or smouldering MS,1 which is distinct \\nfrom relapse-associated worsening (RAW; see \\nFigure 1 for definitions). Based on a synthesis of \\npathology, neuroimaging, and clinical data, we \\npropose that the ‘real MS’ is likely to be driven by \\na primary smouldering process accompanied by a \\nsuperimposed inflammatory activity that poten-\\ntially represents the host immune response to \\nunderlying causes of the disease.2 Overwhelming \\nevidence from MRI and pathological studies indi-\\ncate that the progressive neuroaxonal loss that \\nunderpins the accumulation of unremitting disa-\\nbility is present from the very early stages of the \\ndisease.3–6 From a biological perspective, this \\nwould imply a continuum between the relapsing \\nand progressive stages of MS, which are distin-\\nguished only by quantitative rather than qualita-\\ntive pathological differences.7 What we see \\nclinically is an interplay between the effects of \\nSmouldering multiple sclerosis: the ‘real MS’\\nGavin Giovannoni , Veronica Popescu, Jens Wuerfel, Kerstin Hellwig, Ellen Iacobaeus, \\nMichael B.

We provide a range of evidence \\nto argue that the ‘real MS’ is in fact driven primarily by a smouldering pathological disease \\nprocess. In natural history studies and clinical trials, relapses and focal activity revealed \\nby magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in MS patients on placebo or on disease-modifying \\ntherapies (DMTs) were found to be poor predictors of long-term disease evolution and were \\ndissociated from disability outcomes. In addition, the progressive accumulation of disability \\nin MS can occur independently of relapse activity from early in the disease course. This \\nscenario is underpinned by a more diffuse smouldering pathological process that may affect \\nthe entire CNS. Many putative pathological drivers of smouldering MS can be potentially \\nmodified by specific therapeutic strategies, an approach that may have major implications \\nfor the management of MS patients. We hypothesise that therapeutically targeting a state \\nof ‘no evident inflammatory disease activity’ (NEIDA) cannot sufficiently prevent disability \\naccumulation in MS, meaning that treatment should also focus on other brain and spinal cord \\npathological processes contributing to the slow loss of neurological function. This should \\nalso be complemented with a holistic approach to the management of other systemic disease \\nprocesses that have been shown to worsen MS outcomes.\\nKeywords: multiple sclerosis, smouldering multiple sclerosis, progression independent of \\nrelapse activity, progressive multiple sclerosis\\nReceived: 12 August 2021; revised manuscript accepted: 28 November 2021.\\nCorrespondence to:  \\nGavin Giovannoni  \\nBlizard Institute, Barts \\nand The London School of \\nMedicine and Dentistry, \\nQueen Mary University \\nof London, 4 Newark St., \\nWhitechapel, London E1 \\n2AT, UK \\ng.giovannoni@qmul.ac.uk\\n \\nVeronica Popescu  \\nUniversitair MS Centrum, \\nHasselt, Belgium; \\nNoorderhart Hospital, \\nPelt, Belgium; Hasselt \\nUniversity, Hasselt, \\nBelgium\\nJens Wuerfel  \\nMIAC AG, Department of \\nBiomedical Engineering, \\nUniversity of Basel, Basel, \\nSwitzerland; Charité – \\nUniversity Medicine Berlin, \\nBerlin, Germany\\nKerstin Hellwig  \\nKatholisches Klinikum \\nBochum, Klinikum der \\nRuhr-Universität, Bochum, \\nGermany\\nEllen Iacobaeus  \\nKarolinska University \\nHospital, Stockholm, \\nSweden\\nMichael B.

Therefore, \\nthe use of brain atrophy as a biomarker at an indi-\\nvidual patient level can be challenging, whereas at \\na group level, whole-brain volume changes are \\nconsidered an integrator of end-organ damage and \\nare predictive of the clinical outcome.33,34 With the \\nemerging use of new regional brain volume meas-\\nurement techniques and advanced neuroimaging \\ntechniques,35 we believe the measurement of vol-\\nume changes will be gradually incorporated into \\nclinical practice to assist with therapeutic decision-\\nmaking and in the management of individual \\npatients, thus contributing to individualised patient \\ncare (see below).34\\nPathological drivers of smouldering or ‘real’ \\nMS\\nNumerous mechanisms have been proposed to drive \\nsmouldering MS (see Figure 3), several of which are \\narguably downstream of focal inflammatory lesions, \\nwhile others may be independent of focal inflamma-\\ntory lesions and be the cause of MS.\\nFigure 3. The pathological drivers of smouldering MS. Apart from acute focal damage characterised by axonal transection and conduction \\nblock that occurs over days to weeks and causes relapse-associated worsening (RAW), there are delayed time-dependent processes \\nthat are responsible for smouldering MS. Demyelination and energy deficits are responsible for delayed worsening, which occurs over \\nweeks to months. Whether this is dependent or independent of ongoing focal inflammation is a moot point. This is then followed by post-\\ninflammatory neurodegenerative processes, which run their course over many years and include microglial and innate immune mediators, \\nongoing energy deficits, antibody-mediated damage, and possible viral infection.

It \\nremains to be determined whether the axonal \\nregrowth to restore lost function occurs in MS \\nlesions38 similarly to that observed in animals and \\nin the human peripheral nervous system; for \\nexample, in poliomyelitis, the sprouting of surviv-\\ning axons contributes to repair following a patho-\\nlogical insult.40 Therefore, it is plausible to \\nhypothesise that axonal sprouting primes neurons \\nto die off prematurely as a result of an excessive \\nmetabolic burden placed on the surviving axons.40\\nDemyelination\\nDemyelination and acute conduction block are \\nother factors contributing to focal deficits within \\ninflammatory lesions.41 Axonal plasticity or the \\nsynthesis and insertion of sodium channels along \\ndemyelinated axonal segments restores nerve \\nconduction, albeit at a much lower velocity and \\nwith a higher energy requirement.42 These demy-\\nelinated axonal segments have a reduced safety \\nfactor of conduction, making them more suscep-\\ntible to increased temperature or fatigue, and thus \\naccounting for intermittent but reversible symp-\\ntoms such as Uhthoff’s phenomenon.42 In addi-\\ntion, demyelinated axons are less resilient and \\nmore likely to die prematurely due to an excessive \\nmetabolic burden or from axonal excitotoxicity \\nstemming from the proinflammatory microenvi-\\nronment in MS lesions. Although remyelination \\nis well documented in MS, it is incomplete and \\nfails with age.43 As demyelinated axons are more \\nsusceptible to degeneration, the failure of remy-\\nelination in MS is likely to be one of the contrib-\\nuting factors to smouldering MS.44\\nMacrophage/microglial activation\\nActivation of microglia and recruited macrophages \\nare found in acute MS lesions and persists in \\nchronic active and inactive MS lesions. Activated \\nmicroglia produce proinflammatory cytokines and \\ninflammatory mediators, which are hypothesised \\nto drive both acute and chronic axonal loss. Focal \\nsmouldering inflammatory activity has been \\nreported in several MS lesion types, encompassing \\nchronic active/smouldering lesions and subpial \\ncortical lesions. At autopsy, 20–40% of white mat-\\nter lesions are categorised as slowly evolving \\nlesions (SELs).24 These are characterised by a low \\ndegree of inflammation and with T and B cells at \\nthe lesion core, a dense network of activated iron-\\nladen microglia/macrophages expressing the pro-\\ninflammatory markers CD68 and p22phox in a \\nglial wall, and by proliferating oligodendrocytes at \\nthe lesion edge.15,45–48 Microglial activation may \\nalso contribute to the failure of oligodendrocytes \\nto remyelinate neurons, an effect that may be \\ndependent on the stage of the lesions.49\\nIn contrast to other MS lesions, which have a ten-\\ndency to shrink in gliotic stages, SELs with para-\\nmagnetic rims of activated microglia at their edges \\ncontribute to the failure of remyelination, resulting \\nin further destruction of the surrounding paren-\\nchyma.50 The presence of SELs has been correlated \\nwith a more severe clinical outcome.50 In addition, \\npatients with heightened microglial activation, as \\ndetermined by the expression of 18 kDa transloca-\\ntor protein (TSPO) binding to the radioligand \\nPK11195 on positron emission tomography (PET) \\nimaging, are more likely to experience PIRA.51 This \\nobservation suggests that TSPO brain PET ligands \\nare good markers of smouldering MS. A longitudi-\\nnal PET study demonstrated a decrease, but not \\nsuppression, in microglial activation in natalizumab-\\ntreated SPMS patients compared with untreated \\npatients.52 Importantly, this decrease was associated \\nwith slower disability progression during 4 years of \\nfollow-up.52 This implies that trafficking of periph-\\neral immune cells into the CNS contributes to, but \\ndoes not drive, smouldering MS.\\nIt remains to be established if pharmacologically \\nreducing microglial activation will translate into \\nimproved long-term outcomes with established \\nDMTs. CNS-penetrant Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase \\ninhibitors (BTKi), which are known to inhibit \\nmicroglial activation through the Fc-gamma recep-\\ntor, hold promise as a means to prevent disease \\nprogression unrelated to relapses.53,54 This, how-\\never, must be balanced by the potential role that \\nmicroglia play in clearing up debris in the CNS \\nand in promoting remyelination.55 Interestingly, \\nBTKi was recently shown to promote repair. 54 \\nTherefore, the qualitative shift in microglia from a \\nproinflammatory to a pro-remyelinating pheno-\\ntype may prove to play a key role in controlling \\nsmouldering MS.'),\n",

Therefore, iron chelation therapy \\nand the stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible tran-\\nscription factor 1α, which is normally upregulated \\nunder hypoxic conditions, have been proposed as \\npotential neuroprotection strategies in MS. Pilot \\nstudies of the iron chelator deferoxamine have \\nbeen undertaken in MS,64,65 but no follow-on \\nefficacy trials have been attempted.\\nMitochondrial damage and energy deficits\\nThe accumulation of mitochondrial damage in \\nMS lesions was shown to contribute to axonal loss \\nby inducing ‘virtual hypoxia’.66 The mitochon-\\ndrial injury occurs as a consequence of oxidative \\nstress and in some MS lesions defects in mito-\\nchondrial respiratory chain complex IV have been \\ndescribed, thus explaining the hypoxic tissue \\ninjury secondary to energy deficiency.67 Altered \\nmitochondrial function in axons might be of par-\\nticular importance, as this may lead to chronic \\naxonal stress and an imbalance in ion homoeosta-\\nsis, which can result in neuronal death.68\\nIt has been hypothesised that a deficiency of biotin in \\nMS might result in energy deficits,69 where a reduced \\nflux of biotin through the tricarboxylic acid cycle \\nresults in lower ATP production. This occurs as a \\nconsequence of lower biotin-dependent pyruvate \\ncarboxylase activity as well as diminished flow \\nthrough the mitochondrial electron transport chain \\ndue to deficient cytochrome c oxidase or complex IV \\nactivity.70 Early phase 2 trials suggested that high-\\ndose biotin improved disability in a small proportion \\nof subjects with progressive MS,69 but this was not \\nreplicated in a large multicentre phase 3 study. 71 \\nAnimal study results72 suggested that oxygen could \\nserve as a possible therapeutic option for addressing \\nmitochondrial damage in MS.73 However, hyper-\\nbaric oxygen provided no benefit to progressive MS \\npatients.74 A caveat to these observations is that the \\nstudies were carried out when progressive MS trial \\ndesigns were still being developed and studies were \\nclearly underpowered.

This has been described to accelerate \\nneuroaxonal loss in animal models of MS80 and may \\nalso occur in MS patients.76\\nAlthough many people believe that Epstein–Barr \\nVirus (EBV) is the cause of MS, experimental \\nproof is lacking. It has been suggested that persis-\\ntent EBV infection of the CNS drives ongoing \\nMS disease activity.81,82 EBV and other herpes \\nviruses transactivate human endogenous retrovi-\\nruses (HERVs), which are upregulated in the \\nbrains of patients with MS.83 The production of \\nenvelope (Env) proteins from HERV-W and \\nHERV-K induce proinflammatory and superanti-\\ngen (SAg)-like effects,84 which may be relevant to \\nthe pathological processes that drive smouldering \\nMS lesions.

Even among patients with a high \\nnumber of early relapses (⩾3) within the first \\n2 years of the disease, a proportion can experience \\na mild disease course in the long term. 93 Further \\nevidence of a disconnect between the occurrence \\nof relapses and late disability is provided by long-\\nterm follow-up studies of patient cohorts in piv-\\notal DMT clinical trials. Despite treatment of \\npatients with interferon-beta (evident-disease \\nactivity), a larger number of early relapses was \\nassociated with poor long-term outcomes; in con-\\ntrast, in subjects initially randomised to placebo, \\nthe frequency of early attacks had no predictive \\nvalue.94 Similarly, in a large real-world data set  \\nof 2,466 patients followed for at least 10 years,  \\non-therapy relapses carried greater weight than \\noff-therapy relapses in predicting disability pro-\\ngression.95 If focal inflammation detected clini-\\ncally as relapses or radiologically as new lesions \\nwere the primary driver of the MS progression, \\nthen inflammatory attacks and MRI activity would \\nbe expected to predict long-term outcomes both \\nin untreated patients and in those on a DMT.\\nBy applying Prentice Criteria for a surrogate end-\\npoint96 (see Table 2) and deductive reasoning, \\nrelapses and/or focal MRI activity cannot be vali-\\ndated as surrogate endpoints for MS progression \\nand are therefore likely to be an epiphenomenon \\nto the pathological processes driving the disease. \\nWe propose that focal inflammation occurs in \\nresponse to the cause of MS; that is, the real dis-\\nease. The focal inflammatory activity (relapses \\nand/or MRI activity) does not predict disability \\noutcomes in untreated people and is frequently \\nreferred to as the clinico-radiological paradox,97 \\nwhile in patients on a DMT, it represents a \\nmarker that the therapy is not affecting the under-\\nlying primary driver of the MS disease process.\\nAnother example of this paradox concerns the \\nrecent observation that patients with increasing \\nocrelizumab exposure have greater levels of B-cell \\ndepletion in their peripheral blood.98 It was shown \\nthat following the administration of ocrelizumab \\n600 mg every 6 months, serum concentrations of the \\ndrug were higher among subjects weighing  < 60 kg \\nand lower among subjects weighing  > 90 kg, com-\\npared with subjects weighing 60–90 kg.98 This dose \\neffect on B-cell depletion was not reflected in the \\nreduction of relapses or of focal lesions on MRI, as \\nall levels of ocrelizumab exposures were associated \\nwith almost complete suppression of focal inflam-\\nmatory activity.

Whether the \\nhigher ocrelizumab exposure is targeting peripheral \\ndeep tissue B cells or intrathecal B cells is a moot \\npoint, but these observations highlight the need for \\ntargeting mechanisms driving smouldering MS \\nbeyond focal inflammatory events.\\nInterestingly, ofatumumab, a fully humanised \\nmonoclonal anti-CD20 therapy, was shown to be \\nsuperior to teriflunomide in suppressing relapses \\nand focal inflammatory MRI activity, but lacking \\na greater impact on slowing the rate of brain atro-\\nphy over 2 years.100 Therefore, despite its rela-\\ntively modest impact on focal inflammation, \\nteriflunomide successfully impacts the primary \\nMS pathology by reducing brain volume loss.101,102 \\nThese observations further support a disconnec-\\ntion between the systemically driven inflamma-\\ntion and the smouldering pathology occurring in \\nthe end-organ or target organ. In addition, teriflu-\\nnomide is more effective when used as a second \\nor third-line agent,103 raising the question of \\nwhether its undetermined mode of action targets \\nmechanisms that are downstream of inflamma-\\ntion or the processes driving smouldering MS, for \\nexample, by inhibiting microglial responses.104\\nAdvanced imaging\\nAdvanced imaging techniques, which can be defined \\nas imaging modalities that are not yet available in \\nroutine clinical practice, provide an opportunity to \\nassess the microscopic features of MS. For example, \\npathology studies have shown that low-level chronic \\ninflammatory activity in microglial cells is also pre-\\nsent in normal-appearing white and grey matter.105 \\nThe appearance of clusters of microglia precedes in \\nsome cases the formation of microglial lesions106–109 \\n(see Figure 4). Advanced imaging can be used to \\ninvestigate such changes in the normal-appearing \\nwhite matter (NAWM).\\nWith the use of double inversion recovery (DIR) \\nsequences, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), T1w \\nand T2*w relaxometry, as well as magnetization \\ntransfer (MT) imaging, it has been possible to \\nbetter characterise the presence of diffuse, focal \\nand global damage in both the cortical grey and \\nwhite matter,110 which contributes to the motor \\nand cognitive dysfunction in patients. 111 As \\ndescribed above, PET imaging with radiotracers \\ncan be used to target TSPO, the expression of \\nwhich is associated with the density of activated \\ninnate immune cells in MS. This technique dem-\\nonstrated the presence of activated macrophages \\nand microglia in the NAWM.112,113 Interestingly, \\nPET studies also unveiled critical roles played by \\nthe diffuse activation of innate immune cells in \\nthe slow process of tissue deterioration. Compared \\nwith RRMS, increased activation of macrophages \\nand microglia in the NAWM in SPMS was shown \\nto be significantly associated with disability accu-\\nmulation over time51,114 and with the rate of brain \\natrophy.115 It was also shown to be spatially \\nrelated to microstructural damage.115,116\\nSELs exhibit a paramagnetic rim that is detectable \\nin vivo by phase-contrast and susceptibility-\\nweighted MRI.47,117 These lesions are characterised \\nby chronic axonal loss and ongoing demyelina-\\ntion118 (Figure 4). In contrast, chronically inactive \\nMS plaques usually shrink in size on T2w and T1w \\nMRI over the course of several years. SELs with \\niron rims evolve independently of acute blood-\\nbrain barrier breakdown,118 have a lower MTR, \\nincreased radial diffusion,118 are less likely to remy-\\nelinate, and seem to increase the vulnerability of \\nresidual axons to undergo subsequent neurodegen-\\neration.47 Inflammatory mediators in the hypoin-\\ntense lesion rim, such as free radicals or nitric oxide, \\nmay further stimulate a vicious cycle of detrimental \\nsmouldering inflammation and worsening neuro-\\ndegeneration,119 potentially accounting for the \\nchronic disease progression in MS.50\\nAt postmortem, SELs were only found in the \\nbrains of patients who had reached the progressive \\nstage of MS,24 whereas in vivo, SELs can already \\nbe identified in patients in the relapsing stage.47,117 \\nThis suggests that the presence of SELs increases \\nthe risk of transition to progressive MS.\\nThe ultimate consequence of both focal and dif-\\nfuse, and acute and smouldering activity is the loss \\nof brain and spinal cord volume, including specific \\nbrain structures, which relate to both motor and \\ncognitive function and account for disability \\naccrual.

The EDSS is the most commonly \\nused clinical tool, but it is not sufficiently sensitive to \\ndetect subtle changes in disability.123 Moreover, \\nongoing relapses with incomplete recovery can make \\nit difficult to pinpoint the clinical occurrence of pro-\\ngressive accumulation of disability. In addition, the \\nconventional neurological examination is not ade-\\nquate to monitor patients’ deterioration in their daily \\nactivities. By using an engineered glove to measure \\nthe fine motor performance of the fingers, it was \\ndemonstrated that subtle deterioration can occur \\neven in patients with presymptomatic MS or radio-\\nlogically isolated syndrome.124 In line with these \\nobservations, the pooled analysis of the OPERA tri-\\nals demonstrated that an impressively large propor-\\ntion of patients, in both the ocrelizumab- and \\ninterferon-beta-1a-treated groups (87% and 78%, \\nrespectively), experienced PIRA (see Figure 1) \\ndespite being relatively early in the disease course \\n(mean duration approximately 6 years). This was \\nhighlighted by using a composite score, which \\nincluded changes in the timed 25-foot walk \\n(T25FW), the 9-hole peg test (9HPT), or in the \\nEDSS.1 This approach allowed investigators to \\ncharacterise elements of disease progression more \\ncomprehensively, which would most likely have \\nbeen missed on routine neurological examination. \\nOverall, a more thorough assessment of these subtle \\nphysical or cognitive changes during normal activity \\nor under stress might help to better demonstrate the \\nFigure 4.

Similarly, exer-\\ncise and objective gait analysis can be used to detect \\nsubtle gait abnormalities and exercise-induced dete-\\nrioration in mobility.10 Steps are being taken to bet-\\nter capture these subtle changes, examples of which \\ninclude the use of EDSS-plus, which is more sensi-\\ntive to detect worsening in patients with SPMS,125 \\nand of the Overall Response Score (ORS), which is \\nused as a primary outcome measure in some con-\\ntemporary clinical trials investigating putative remy-\\nelination therapies (NCT03222973). Smart devices, \\nsuch as wearables or suites of smartphone applica-\\ntions, can also be used to assess daily functioning.126 \\nThe latter example involves the self-administration \\nof different tasks to assess the impact of MS across \\nmultiple functional domains.\\nActivity trackers and other digital techniques such \\nas ambient measurement systems are a feasible \\nand popular technology for self-monitoring in \\nMS;127 however, the widespread use of devices is \\nhindered by the heterogeneity of measuring tech-\\nniques and algorithms, privacy concerns, and the \\nneed for adaptation specifically to MS.128 Patient-\\nreported outcomes are validated techniques that \\nquantify MS patients’ own experiences of their \\ndisease, addressing several domains (depression, \\nanxiety, fatigue, pain interference, physical func-\\ntion, cognition) and can be easily administered \\ndigitally via apps and software packages.129\\nChanges in cognitive performance can also reflect \\nsmouldering processes in MS to some extent. The \\nevolution of cognitive deterioration, which can occur \\nfrom a very early stage of the disease,130 is weakly \\nassociated with the inflammatory disease activity as \\nmeasured by the accrual of new/enlarging T2w \\nlesions.131,132 By using functional MRI or DTI, it has \\nbeen demonstrated that cognitive impairment is bet-\\nter accounted for by the subtle worsening of grey mat-\\nter pathology, and by network disruption and axonal \\ndegeneration, irrespective of inflammatory changes.133\\nBrain health\\nThere is mounting evidence that many additional \\nfactors that impact brain function and brain health \\ncan potentially exacerbate and interact with \\nsmouldering MS, resulting in more rapid disease \\nworsening.

How combination trials \\nare designed and performed will be a challenge for \\nregulators and the wider MS community. For \\nexample, designing studies where the primary out-\\ncome is the recovery of function is proving to be a \\nchallenge with currently available outcome meas-\\nures. Another aspect to be considered is add-on \\nneurorehabilitation to help augment recovery \\nmechanisms by stimulating biological processes \\nsuch as neuroplasticity.142\\nConclusion\\nWe have presented evidence supporting the notion \\nthat MS as a disease entity is not focal inflamma-\\ntion, that is, relapses and focal MRI activity, but a \\nmore diffuse smouldering pathological process \\nthat affects the entire CNS. We therefore need to \\ngo beyond no evident inflammatory disease activ-\\nity (NEIDA) and focus on other pathological pro-\\ncesses in the end-organ (brain and spinal cord) in \\norder to delay or prevent the slow loss of neuro-\\nlogical function in people with MS. In addition, a \\nholistic approach to the management of MS is \\nneeded by targeting other processes that have \\nbeen shown to impact on brain health.\\nAuthor contributions\\nGavin Giovannoni: Conceptualization; Writing \\n– original draft.\\nVeronica Popescu: Conceptualization; Writing \\n– review & editing.\\nJens Wuerfel: Conceptualization; Writing – \\nreview & editing.\\nKerstin Hellwig: Conceptualization; Writing – \\nreview & editing.\\nEllen Iacobaeus: Conceptualization; Writing – \\nreview & editing.\\nMichael B.

Bryan E. Davis . Cherie C. Binns . Keisha M. Currie .\\nMary R. Rensel\\nReceived: January 29, 2021 / Accepted: March 3, 2021 / Published online: April 20, 2021\\n/C211 The Author(s) 2021, corrected publication 2021\\nABSTRACT\\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune\\ninﬂammatory disease of the central nervous sys-\\ntem, leading to neurodegeneration and mani-\\nfesting as a variety of symptoms. These can\\ninclude ‘‘invisible’’ symptoms, not externally\\nevident to others, such as fatigue, mood disor-\\nders, cognitive impairments, pain, bladder/\\nbowel dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and\\nvision changes. Invisible symptoms are highly\\nprevalent in people living with MS, with multi-\\nfactorial etiology and potential to impact the\\ndisease course. Patient experiences of these\\nsymptoms include both physical and psychoso-\\ncial elements, which when unaddressed nega-\\ntively inﬂuence many aspects of quality of life\\nand perception of health. Despite the high\\nimpact on patient lives, gaps persist in awareness\\nand management of these hidden symptoms.\\nThe healthcare provider and patient author\\nexperiences brought together here serve to raise\\nthe proﬁle of invisible symptoms and review\\nstrategies for a team-based approach to compre-\\nhensive MS care. We summarize the current lit-\\nerature regarding the prevalence and etiology of\\ninvisible symptoms to convey the high likeli-\\nhood that a person living with MS will contend\\nwith one or more of these concerns. We then\\nexplore how open communication between\\npeople living with MS and their care team, stigma\\nmitigation, and shared decision-making are key\\nto comprehensive management of invisible\\nsymptoms. We recommend validated screening\\ntools and technological advancements that may\\nbe incorporated into MS care to regularly moni-\\ntor these symptoms, offering insight into how\\nhealthcare providers can both educate and listen\\nto patients, with the goal of improved patient\\nquality of life. By pairing clinical knowledge with\\nan understanding and consideration of the\\npatient perspective, providers will be equipped to\\nfoster a patient-centered dialogue that encour-\\nages shared decision-making.\\nSupplementary Information The online version\\ncontains supplementary material available at https://\\ndoi.org/10.1007/s40120-021-00239-2.\\nL.

This\\nneurodegeneration can lead to a variety of\\nclinical symptoms that can vary from patient to\\npatient. People living with MS and their care\\nteams are generally well-versed in the symp-\\ntoms of MS that are easily seen externally, such\\nas difﬁculty walking, muscle spasms, or weak-\\nness. However, people living with MS experi-\\nence many symptoms outside of obvious\\ndisability or other visible signs, which have\\nbeen described as ‘‘invisible’’ symptoms due to\\ntheir lack of external physical indicators. Com-\\nmonly reported invisible symptoms can\\ninclude, but are not limited to, fatigue, mood\\nchanges, cognitive changes, physical and emo-\\ntional pain, spasticity, bowel/bladder dysfunc-\\ntion, sexual dysfunction, and vision changes\\n[2, 3].\\nInvisible symptoms are common among\\npeople living with MS and may have a signiﬁ-\\ncant impact on their mental health, social roles/\\ninteractions, employment, daily living, and\\nquality of life (QoL) [ 3]. They may also con-\\ntribute more to patients’ perception of their\\nhealth than visible symptoms of MS, and may\\ncause reductions in QoL independent of\\nExpanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes\\n[2, 4–7]. Despite their impact on QoL and high\\nprevalence amongst people living with MS,\\nawareness of these invisible symptoms remains\\nlow. Many people living with MS ﬁnd that their\\ninvisible symptoms are dismissed by others,\\nincluding family, colleagues, and healthcare\\nproviders (HCPs), because they visibly appear\\nhealthy [ 3]. Additionally, people living with MS\\nmay ﬁnd certain invisible symptoms difﬁcult to\\ndiscuss with their provider, which can further\\nhinder appropriate assessment and treatment of\\ninvisible symptoms [ 7–11]. When unaddressed,\\nsome symptoms may exacerbate one another\\nand/or disease progression; for example,\\nundertreated mental health conditions have\\nbeen associated with disability progression [ 12].\\nIn order to more consistently address invisible\\nsymptoms, new programs, such as the Multiple\\nSclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and\\nHealth Solutions (MS PATHS) program, hope to\\nuse technological advancements to capture\\ninformation on invisible symptoms in routine\\nMS care and subsequently provide standardized\\ndata across institutions to better inform\\nNeurol Ther (2021) 10:75–98 77'),\n",

Here, we\\nprovide a brief overview of the prevalence of\\ninvisible symptoms of MS in the literature and\\nshare experiences from our patient authors on\\nhow invisible symptoms may manifest\\n(Table 1).\\nMS fatigue is generally considered to be one\\nof the most common invisible symptoms\\nexperienced by people living with MS. While\\nthe reported prevalence varies in the literature,\\napproximately 80% of people living with MS\\nmay experience fatigue according to the\\nNational MS Society [ 17]. MS fatigue can\\ninclude cognitive/mental, emotional, and\\nphysical components, although many patients\\nwho report fatigue are unaware of how encom-\\npassing it can be and report only the physical\\naspect of it. Cognitive fatigue is broadly deﬁned\\nas mental exhaustion after completing a task,\\nwhile emotional fatigue refers to feeling emo-\\ntionally overwhelmed or drained [ 18, 19].\\nPhysical fatigue is characterized by a lack of\\nphysical energy which may limit mobility, par-\\nticipation in the community, and/or physical\\nfunctioning [ 18, 19]. MS fatigue is often asso-\\nciated with sleep disorders; in a survey of 2375\\npeople living with MS, 70% of respondents had\\nat least one sleep disorder according to ques-\\ntionnaire responses [20]. Despite the high per-\\ncentage of responses indicating a sleep disorder,\\nonly a small fraction of these individuals had\\nbeen diagnosed by a physician [20]. Frequently\\noverlooked sleep disorders in people living with\\nMS include insomnia, restless leg syndrome,\\nperiodic limb movement disorders, and sleep-\\nrelated breathing disorders [ 21]. Fatigue in\\npeople living with MS has psychosocial impacts,\\nand has long been associated with depression\\nand anxiety, both of which can involve sleep\\ndisruption as a symptom [ 22–24].\\nMood and mental health disorders of many\\ntypes are more prevalent in people living with\\nMS as compared to the general population\\n[25, 26]. A recent meta-analysis of 58 studies\\nreported a prevalence of 30.5% for depression\\nand 22.1% for anxiety in people living with MS\\n[27], compared to 7% and 19%, respectively, in\\nthe general population [ 28]. Depression is fre-\\nquently comorbid with anxiety, which in turn\\nhas been shown to be associated with suicidal\\nideation [ 29–33]. Despite the need to identify\\nand address mood and mental health disorders,\\nappropriate recognition and diagnosis can be\\ncomplicated by other psychiatric comorbidities.\\nFor example, pseudobulbar affect (which may\\naffect 10–46% of people living with MS),\\nwherein people experience sudden, brief, exag-\\ngerated expressions of laughing or crying that\\nmay not match their actual mood, has distinct\\netiology from mood disorders but may result in\\nsimilar symptom presentations [34, 35].

Such changes occur in the early stages\\nof MS in 20–45% of cases and frequently are\\nalready present at the time of MS diagnosis\\n[39–42]. Generally, in the early phases of MS,\\nprocessing speed and executive functions are\\nimpaired, with changes in memory and atten-\\ntion beginning later in the disease course\\n[42–44]. Patients may also experience a change\\nin cognitive ability that does not meet the\\nclinical threshold for impairment, but may still\\ncontribute to a reduced QoL [38, 45]. A sys-\\ntematic review of 12 studies examining\\nemployment for people living with MS found\\nthat individuals with MS who were unemployed\\nor had reduced their working hours displayed\\npoorer performance on cognitive tests than\\npeople living with MS who had not changed\\ntheir employment status [ 46]. This is aligned\\nwith prior studies suggesting that people living\\nwith MS may leave the workforce early due to\\ncognitive impairments and/or negative work\\nevents caused by them [ 47, 48]. Cognitive\\nimpairment is also an important concern for\\npediatric-onset MS (POMS); in a population-\\nbased longitudinal cohort study of the Swedish\\nMS Registry, individuals with POMS had higher\\nrates of cognitive decline as adults relative to\\nthose with adult-onset MS [49]. The cognitive\\nimpairments experienced by children and ado-\\nlescents with POMS create a barrier to com-\\npleting their education, which would have\\nimpacts well into adult life [ 50].\\nPain prevalence rates in people living with\\nMS vary widely in the literature, with estimates\\nin the range of 29–86% [ 51–55]. Historically,\\npain was not considered a symptom of MS, but\\nHCPs now recognize that pain exists for many\\nindividuals with MS and impacts many aspects\\nof their lives [ 56]. A variety of pain types are\\nassociated with MS, including neuropathic\\npain, trigeminal neuralgia, burning limb pain,\\nand musculoskeletal pain [ 51, 56, 57]. In a sur-\\nvey of 1865 MS outpatients, pain was docu-\\nmented as the top contributing symptom to a\\npatient’s perception of health, followed by gait\\ndysfunction and fatigue [4]. Pain has also long\\nbeen known to worsen the mental health of\\npeople living with MS [ 9]. In the case of chronic\\npain, social functioning and mental health are\\nmore likely to be impaired among people living\\nwith MS, and the extent of impairment is asso-\\nciated with the severity of pain [10]. In a survey\\nof participants in the North American Research\\nCommittee on Multiple Sclerosis registry, 65%\\nof respondents indicated they would deﬁnitely\\nor probably consider physician-assisted suicide\\nif experiencing unbearable pain, demonstrating\\nthe impact of chronic pain on QoL and hope-\\nlessness, and the urgent need to address pain\\n[58]. For some individuals with MS, pain may\\ntrigger or aggravate spasticity, which occurs in\\napproximately 40% of people living with MS\\n[59, 60]. Spasticity, deﬁned as feelings of stiff-\\nness and/or involuntary muscle movements,\\nmay manifest within a wide range of severity\\n[61]. People living with MS have reported that\\nspasticity has negative impacts on their activi-\\nties of daily living and QoL [ 60].\\nBladder and bowel dysfunction is also fre-\\nquently reported by people living with MS. At\\nleast 80% of people living with MS experience\\nsome degree of bladder dysfunction according\\nto the National MS Society [62], which is\\napproximately three times as common as that\\namong the general population, in which the\\naverage prevalence of female urinary inconti-\\nnence is 27.6% [ 63]. Common types of bladder\\ndysfunction include increased frequency and/or\\nurgency of urination, hesitancy in starting uri-\\nnation, higher frequency of nighttime urina-\\ntion, retention, and incontinence [62].\\nUntreated bladder problems can lead to wors-\\nening of other MS symptoms, increased risk of\\nbladder or urinary tract infections, and reduced\\nQoL [62, 64]. Bowel problems also may occur for\\npeople living with MS, with duration of disease\\nand disability severity increasing the likelihood\\nof experiencing symptoms [ 65, 66]. Approxi-\\nmately 50% of people living with MS experience\\nneurogenic bowel dysfunction (fecal\\nNeurol Ther (2021) 10:75–98 81'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Carlini\\\\OneDrive - Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna\\\\Articoli\\\\MS\\\\s40120-021-00239-2.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='incontinence and/or constipation), which may\\ncause humiliation and distress [ 67, 68]. In\\naddition to neurogenic bowel dysfunction,\\npeople living with MS may experience gas-\\ntrointestinal disorders, although the connec-\\ntion between gastrointestinal disorders and MS\\nrequires further study [ 69]. In a survey of 6312\\npeople living with MS, approximately 42%\\nexperienced gastrointestinal disorders, most\\ncommonly irritable bowel syndrome [ 70]. These\\ngastrointestinal disorders are associated with\\nlower physical and mental QoL [70].\\nAccording to the National MS Society, as\\nmany as 91% of men and 72% of women living\\nwith MS may experience sexual problems [71].\\nPrevalence rates for sexual problems vary in the\\nliterature, but are generally high, yet these\\nsymptoms have a high risk of undertreatment\\nbecause HCPs frequently do not initiate con-\\nversations about this topic and patients do not\\nalways feel comfortable doing so themselves\\n[72, 73]. Sexual dysfunction experienced by\\npeople living with MS can manifest in several\\ndifferent ways [74]. Men with MS are most likely\\nto experience erectile dysfunction (50–75%),\\nejaculatory dysfunction and/or orgasmic dys-\\nfunction (50%), reduced libido (39%), and\\nanorgasmia (37%) [ 75–77]. Frequently described\\ntypes of sexual dysfunction in women are\\nreduced libido (58–64%), anorgasmia (37–67%),\\nand vaginal dryness with subsequent dyspareu-\\nnia (23–52%) [ 74, 78–82].\\nFinally, vision problems are often experi-\\nenced by people living with MS, with the most\\ncommon concerns being reduced visual acuity,\\nreduction in contrast sensitivity, changes to\\ncolor vision, and ocular motility disorders\\n[83, 84]. In a survey of 9107 respondents with\\nMS in the North American Research Committee\\non Multiple Sclerosis registry, 60% of people\\nreported some kind of vision problem on the\\nVision Performance Scale [ 85]. Inﬂammation of\\nthe optic nerve, known as optic neuritis, is cited\\nas the ﬁrst symptom of MS for approximately\\n20% of patients and occurs during the MS dis-\\nease course in 50% of cases [ 86]. Vision prob-\\nlems are inversely correlated with health-related\\nQoL in people living with MS, largely due to\\npatients experiencing reductions in their gen-\\neral vision, lessened ability to do near and dis-\\ntance activities, limitations on their ability to\\nfulﬁll roles in daily life, and decreased capacity\\nto drive [84, 87, 88].\\nWhat Causes Invisible Symptoms?\\nThe majority of these invisible symptoms are\\ndue to the lesions of MS. Some of these can be\\nworsened for secondary and tertiary reasons\\nsuch as a complication of a change that occur-\\nred due to a lesion or a psychosocial change. For\\nexample, fatigue is known to have multifacto-\\nrial etiology, with ‘‘primary fatigue’’ deriving\\nfrom lesions/inﬂammation in the CNS and their\\nsequelae, and ‘‘secondary fatigue’’ arising due to\\nother invisible symptoms, adverse effects of\\nmedication, and/or comorbid sleep disorders\\n[24, 89, 90]. Fatigue may also be caused by other\\nmedical conditions, such as hypothyroidism,\\ncardiopulmonary disease, or anemia; this con-\\nfounds the identiﬁcation of fatigue as a symp-\\ntom of MS. For sexual dysfunction, these\\nvarious contributions to etiology are formally\\ncategorized into ‘‘primary’’ factors (lesions in\\nthe neural pathways for sexual functions),\\n‘‘secondary’’ factors (muscle weakness, fatigue,\\nand other MS symptoms), and ‘‘tertiary’’ factors\\n(psychological inﬂuences such as altered self-\\nesteem or changes to relationships, emotional\\nfactors, and cultural effects) [ 74].\\nAdditionally, as some people living with MS\\ndescribe their symptom clusters to providers, it\\nmay be apparent that in the individual, there is\\na ‘‘snowball effect’’ that compounds those\\ncomplaints. For example, pain or urinary fre-\\nquency can wake a person multiple times dur-\\ning the night, causing sleep to be interrupted\\nand therefore adding to daytime fatigue. This\\nfatigue may minimize the patient’s capacity to\\nperform mindful movement/exercise, and sub-\\nsequently pain increases the following night\\nand a vicious cycle is set in motion.\\n82 Neurol Ther (2021) 10:75–98'),\n",

Stress may be associated with MS onset\\nand relapse, with some studies suggesting a link\\nbetween stress and an increase in lesion activity\\n[91–93]. Additionally, a recent preclinical study\\nin an animal model of MS examined metabolite\\nchanges following either physical or psycho-\\nlogical stress [ 94]. The study found that oligo-\\ndendrocytes in rats that experienced either type\\nof stress prior to demyelination had altered\\nlevels of metabolites suggestive of changes in\\nneuronal integrity/viability and cell membrane\\nsynthesis relative to unstressed controls [ 94].\\nLikewise, anxiety may be associated with an\\nincreased risk of disease activity, including\\nrelapses, disability worsening, and MRI activity\\n[6]. Meanwhile, conﬂicting evidence exists\\nregarding the potential impact of cognitive\\ndecline on disease course. Cognitive decline,\\nwhich has been suggested to be strongly asso-\\nciated with cortical atrophy patterns, has been\\nshown to be predictive of MS disease\\nprogression [ 95, 96]. Additionally, deep grey\\nmatter volume, diffusive changes in the thala-\\nmus, and hippocampal volume have been cor-\\nrelated with cognitive performance in several\\nstudies [97]. In a study of 46 people living with\\nMS and 14 healthy controls, people living with\\nMS experiencing cognitive fatigue had more\\nrelapses and developed more brain atrophy\\nduring 17 months of observation than did\\npatients without cognitive fatigue [ 98]. How-\\never, cognitive fatigue may also be a conse-\\nquence of brain atrophy, and is related to brain\\nvolume and lesion burden, confounding the\\nunderstanding of a causative relationship\\n[99, 100].\\nPeople living with MS have also referred to\\nfeedback loops in which unmitigated invisible\\nsymptoms promote disability severity/progres-\\nsion. A person living with MS may be experi-\\nencing depression/fatigue/social anxiety, and\\nwithout proper support may have reduced\\nmotivation to exercise; subsequently, their\\nweakness and gait impairment progress. In\\nsome cases, invisible symptoms accelerate dis-\\nease progression, and yet disease progression\\ncan result in worsened invisible symptoms.\\nGiven this close relationship and possible feed-\\nback loop between disease progression and\\ninvisible symptoms, addressing invisible\\nFig. 1 Decision tree for addressing invisible symptoms as part of MS care.

Issues of communication permeate the\\npatient perspective of managing invisible\\nsymptoms. A recent meta-analysis assessing the\\nnotion of ‘‘invisibility’’ in relation to people’s\\nlived experience of symptoms of MS showed\\nthat patients may experience difﬁculty dis-\\ncussing their symptoms, as they may feel\\nmisunderstood or invalidated when seeking\\ncare [ 3].

Further, when\\npatients describe their symptoms, HCPs should\\nbe aware that word choice may not ﬁt neatly\\ninto medical deﬁnitions and should work to\\nensure that people living with MS are appro-\\npriately heard.\\nThe clinical interview may be conceptualized\\nas the initial step of a screening process,\\nwherein the provider gathers qualitative infor-\\nmation from the person living with MS. Strate-\\ngies such as motivational interviewing may help\\nto normalize invisible symptoms and create an\\nenvironment where the patient feels comfort-\\nable opening up about difﬁcult symptoms\\nassociated with MS [ 102]. Techniques to employ\\ninclude the ‘‘RULE’’ principles: Resist the right-\\ning reﬂex, Understand your patient’s motiva-\\ntion, Listen to your patient, and Empower your\\npatient [103]. These techniques can be paired\\nwith counseling techniques known as OARS:\\nOpen-ended questions, Afﬁrmations, Reﬂective\\nlistening, and Summaries [103]. Taken together,\\nthese approaches can help to identify patient\\nself-stigmatizing, self-doubt, and self-judging.\\nHCPs should also guide patients on how to\\nreach them when the patient has a concern or\\nquestion and ensure the responsiveness of\\nassistive staff.\\nScreening tools, paired with a detailed clini-\\ncal interview, can be utilized to identify invisi-\\nble symptoms in people living with MS; we\\nrecommend some validated screening tools in\\nTable2. Additional screening tools for MS\\nsymptom assessment are offered by the\\nNational MS Society [ 104]. Despite the avail-\\nability of such screening tools, patients may\\nﬁnd that HCPs diagnose/assess invisible symp-\\ntoms with reservation, and assessment tools\\nmay not be used consistently.\\nGenerally, there is a neurological exam\\nperformed, but it is subjective and by no\\nmeans inclusive of invisible symptoms.\\n—Keisha Currie\\nScreening for invisible symptoms can allow\\nfor early implementation of interventions that\\ncan help improve QoL for people living with\\nMS. For instance, upon identiﬁcation of cogni-\\ntive decline, techniques for remediating this at\\nwork (e.g., minimizing distractions in the work\\narea, multi-tasking less frequently) improve\\nproductivity and give people living with MS a\\nsense of control over cognitive fatigue [105].\\nQoL itself may be monitored in people living\\nwith MS by documenting patient-reported out-\\ncomes (PROs).

To that end, QoL has\\nbeen proposed as important to monitor in\\naddition to EDSS scores and MRI [ 106]. A widely\\nused option is the Short Form 36 questionnaire\\n(SF-36), which uses 36 questions to examine\\nphysical and social functioning, role limitations\\ndue to physical and emotional problems, bodily\\npain, general health perception, vitality, and\\nmental health [ 107, 108]. Some other QoL\\nassessment tools expand upon the SF-36, such\\nas the MS Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) and\\nMS Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI)\\n[109, 110]. Recently, the Quality of Life in\\nNeurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) measure-\\nment system was developed to serve as a neu-\\nrology-speciﬁc screening tool for QoL; it\\nincludes multiple physical, mental, and social\\nhealth parameters relevant to individuals with\\nneurological conditions [111, 112].\\nRegular screening to monitor invisible\\nsymptoms and QoL in people living with MS\\nmay become easier as technology-enabled\\nassessments are integrated into clinical care. For\\nexample, the MS PATHS program uses an iPad-\\nbased device, called the Multiple Sclerosis Per-\\nformance Test (MSPT), to collect assessments\\ncompleted by patients that are standardized\\nacross ten healthcare institutions, which not\\nonly enables improved care of individuals, but\\nalso generates data for research [ 13]. The MSPT\\nincludes the Processing Speed Test (PST) for\\ncognitive function, the Contrast Sensitivity Test\\n(CST) for visual acuity, the Manual Dexterity\\nTest (MDT) for upper extremity function, a\\npatient history questionnaire, and the Neuro-\\nQoL test [113, 114]. In an analysis of 8022 fol-\\nlow-up visits from 4199 patients in which the\\nMSPT was integrated into visits, the tablet-based\\ndata collection resulted in more patients com-\\npleting assessment and in a shorter time frame\\nrelative to analog methods, making it easier to\\nincorporate these tests into care in spite of time\\nconstraints placed on HCPs [ 115]. Digitally\\nadministered tools also hold promise for use via\\ntelehealth, which has become important during\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic; early work seeking to\\nvalidate remote use of the Symbol Digit\\nModalities Test (SDMT) and California Verbal\\nLearning Test (CVLT-II) suggests that these tools\\nmay be effectively used remotely [ 116]. Such\\nself-administered and/or remote technology-\\nbased screening tools are likely the future of\\ninvisible symptom monitoring, as they can help\\nto streamline information collection, thus\\nallowing more concerns to be addressed in a\\nshorter amount of time during clinical visits.\\nAs invisible symptoms play an outsized role\\nin patient lives both clinically and socially, it is\\nessential to incorporate regular monitoring of\\nthese symptoms into MS care. These screening\\ntools can encourage more comprehensive con-\\nversations and open communication between\\nthe person living with MS and their HCPs. Fur-\\nther, these screening tools can help determine\\nwhether referral for additional testing with a\\nspecialist is needed. It is worth noting that\\nadministering screening tools does require time,\\nand therefore providers may prioritize which\\ntools to utilize based on the clinical interview\\nand quality of the screen.\\nMitigate Stigma\\nIn addition to the difﬁculties of navigating the\\nhealthcare system, people living with MS may\\nalso deal with challenging decisions around\\ninvisible symptoms in their personal and pro-\\nfessional lives. Many of these decisions are\\nfueled by managing or avoiding stigma from\\ncolleagues, family members, friends, and even\\nstrangers. The fact that many MS symptoms are\\nnot visible can create an illusion that a person\\nwith MS is not sick, and individuals who are not\\nvisibly sick are often not perceived as deserving\\nof the care and accommodations they need\\n[135]. Examples of stigma encountered by peo-\\nple living with MS include presumptions from\\nothers that a person with a handicapped placard\\nmust always have a visible disability or be of a\\ncertain age, and misinterpreting MS-related\\nsleep disorders/fatigue as choosing to make\\nfewer household contributions. The paradox\\npeople living with MS face is that by disclosing\\ntheir MS to someone, they are exposing them-\\nselves to stigmatization or over-sympathizing,\\nbut by opting not to disclose MS, people living\\nwith MS are at risk of going without helpful\\n86 Neurol Ther (2021) 10:75–98'),\n",

Opting not to\\ndisclose MS can exacerbate mental health con-\\ncerns due to the internalization/suppression of\\nsymptoms and dealing with them alone. Indi-\\nviduals with MS experiencing higher rates of\\nstigma may report higher rates of depression\\n[136] and lower QoL [ 137]. Thus, people living\\nwith MS experience a ‘‘burden of choice’’ when\\nmanaging the decision to disclose or not to\\ndisclose their MS and/or the invisible symptoms\\nthey experience [ 3, 138].\\nEvery day you wake up and do an inven-\\ntory of what body parts are functioning\\nproperly, ﬁrst. Then, you decide if you are\\ngoing to lie to yourself and others and say,\\n‘‘I’m ﬁne,’’ when asked how you are doing\\nbecause you know it is easier.\\n—Keisha Currie\\nThis decision may be particularly difﬁcult to\\nnavigate in the workplace, where issues of\\nstigma from supervisors/colleagues may collide\\nwith a patient’s health concerns [ 139–142].\\nTherefore, it can be beneﬁcial for people living\\nwith MS to speak with a vocational or rehabili-\\ntation counselor about what is disclosed to an\\nemployer. Stigma can even be experienced in\\nhealthcare settings; people living with MS may\\nencounter assumptions of drug-seeking behav-\\nior when trying to address pain.\\nAs an administrator of a 35,000-member\\nonline group of people living with MS, I\\noften hear, ‘‘We are not taken seriously!’’, ‘‘I\\nam treated as a drug seeker,’’ and ‘‘The\\ndoctor doesn’t believe me because they\\ncan’t see how this impacts me because I\\nlook good during the visit.’’\\n—Cherie Binns\\nGiven that patients are likely to encounter\\njudgment from those not knowledgeable about\\nMS and invisible symptoms, HCPs should dis-\\ncuss stigma mitigation strategies with their\\npatients. Building networks of trusted friends\\nand family can help alleviate both stigma and\\nsocial isolation experienced by people living\\nwith MS [143]. Support groups afﬁliated with an\\nMS center or on social media can help to nor-\\nmalize and legitimize the experiences of people\\nliving with MS [144]. Family support, or lack\\nthereof, is also an important consideration for\\nthe burden of disease brought on by both\\ninvisible symptoms and mental health issues in\\nMS. Those with a strong support system can\\ninclude family members in the management of\\ninvisible symptoms, for example by guiding\\ntheir family members in how to recognize MS\\nfatigue and how to help [ 145]. Education of\\nfamily members can be facilitated by using\\nvisual aids such as educational pamphlets,\\nexplaining symptoms with relevant speciﬁc\\nexamples, or holding moderated discussions\\nwith family and partners to assist in sharing and\\nvalidating the patient’s views and experiences\\n[146].\\nHCPs should also keep in mind cultural and\\nsocietal issues that may contribute to stigma\\nand stress in patients’ lives [147].\\nOften, African Americans have religious\\nviews and will reply, ‘‘Just pray about it!’’’\\nto imply that God will simply take my MS\\naway. Thankfully, I had developed my own\\nviews about this shortly after diagnosis or\\nit would have been more isolating.\\n—Keisha Currie\\nPeople living with MS from minority back-\\ngrounds not only experience the general stigma\\nencountered by MS patients of other races, but\\nalso are more likely to have an inherent distrust\\nof the medical system due to racial bias\\nencountered in healthcare, have religious views\\nthat inﬂuence decision-making, encounter lan-\\nguage barriers during clinical visits, and/or have\\nlower socioeconomic/educational status [ 148].\\nHCPs should consider the needs of minority\\ncommunities when designing educational\\nevents and tools aimed at stigma mitigation.\\nCustomize the topics discussed for the speciﬁc\\naudience, provide simple access to events (e.g.,\\nscheduled at times compatible with a variety of\\nwork schedules), and share offerings in multiple\\nlanguages when appropriate [ 149].\\nShared Decision-Making\\nThe concept of shared decision-making has\\nbeen growing in recent years across healthcare\\nin general.

Patients who feel they are\\nmaking care decisions together with their pro-\\nviders have been shown to have higher satis-\\nfaction with their treatment [151, 152].\\nEffective shared decision-making involves HCPs\\nengaging patients in their care, taking the time\\nto compare treatment options with the patient,\\nlearning what matters to their patient, and\\nultimately coming to a satisfactory decision as a\\nteam [150, 153].\\nI feel that HCPs can have honest conver-\\nsations with patients about how their MS is\\npresenting, how management strategies\\ncan be beneﬁcial, and long-term planning.\\n—Keisha Currie\\nTo achieve such honest conversations, both\\npatients and providers may take steps to\\nactively participate in the management process\\nand educate each other about invisible\\nsymptoms.\\nProvider Perspectives\\nAs discussed earlier, establishing open commu-\\nnication and listening to patients’ experiences\\nof invisible symptoms is an important step in\\nachieving shared decision-making and equip-\\nping HCPs with a better understanding of\\npatient QoL. Figure1 summarizes how the\\nroutine use of screening tools can encourage\\nopen communication and help determine\\nwhether referral to a specialist is needed (Fig.1).\\nHCPs should also keep in mind that invisible\\nsymptoms may be more distressing to patients\\nthan the visible symptoms of MS or potential\\nside effects of medication [ 2, 4]. Indeed, chan-\\nges in abilities and the resulting QoL reduction\\ncan create periods in patient lives similar to\\ngrieving [ 36]. A component of this impact may\\nderive from the psychosocial consequences of\\nstigma patients experience around their invisi-\\nble symptoms. Thus, providers should focus on\\ntheir patient’s experience of which invisible\\nsymptoms and/or side effects are more or less\\ndifﬁcult to live with, rather than making\\nassumptions; an example of this interaction is\\nprovided in Fig. 2.\\nHCPs can begin the shared decision-making\\nprocess by educating their patients on basic\\nguidelines for healthy lifestyle habits and self-\\nempowerment that can improve invisible\\nsymptoms, summarized in Fig. 3. Both non-\\npharmacological and pharmacological strate-\\ngies for symptom management may be consid-\\nered when deciding on an approach in\\npartnership with patients; speciﬁc symptom\\nmanagement options and considerations for\\nimplementation have been reviewed previously\\n[154–156]. Frequently utilized pharmacological\\noptions are also summarized by the National MS\\nSociety [ 157]. Common examples of non-phar-\\nmacological ways to manage these symptoms\\nmay include bladder/pelvic training with a\\nphysical therapist, dietary adjustments, exer-\\ncise, meditation, music therapy, and/or support\\ngroups. For example, non-pharmacological\\ntreatments including exercise and cognitive\\ntraining may improve patients’ cognitive func-\\ntion at relatively low cost and with minimal side\\neffects [ 158]. Likewise, energy conservation\\ntraining with an occupational therapist and\\ncognitive rehabilitation therapy with an occu-\\npational/speech therapist or neuropsychologist\\nmay also provide beneﬁts for managing these\\nsymptoms [159, 160]. Cognitive behavioral\\ntherapy has also been suggested to be effective\\nin managing a variety of invisible symptoms,\\nsuch as insomnia and pain [161, 162], and has\\nthe potential to maintain effectiveness when\\nadministered digitally as well [ 163]. In the case\\nof sexual dysfunction, the type of dysfunction\\nshould be considered to appropriately guide\\npatients. For example, sensory changes can be\\naddressed by recommending different forms of\\nstimulus, dryness can be managed with lubri-\\ncants, and libido can be increased by working to\\nmanage other symptoms (e.g., depression,\\nbowel/bladder changes, fatigue) [ 73, 164].\\nWhen pharmacotherapy is warranted, many\\nsymptoms including bladder spasticity/reten-\\ntion, bowel problems (irritable bowel syn-\\ndrome/constipation), fatigue, cognitive decline\\n(attention deﬁcit, speciﬁcally), depression,\\nheadaches, sexual dysfunction, and paresthe-\\nsia/pain can be effectively managed with\\n88 Neurol Ther (2021) 10:75–98'),\n",

People living with MS are often\\ninterested in considering holistic approaches to\\npain management, such as mindfulness, yoga,\\nor music therapy [ 170]. Non-pharmacological\\napproaches may lead to clinically meaningful\\nreductions in pain interference scores [ 171], and\\nmindfulness meditation has been shown to be\\neffective for pain reduction even during the\\nadministration of an opioid antagonist, sug-\\ngesting a combination of mindfulness and\\npharmacotherapy may be particularly effective\\nfor pain management [ 172]. For individuals\\nwhere pain medication is needed, HCPs and\\npatients should set shared goals and discuss\\nchoice of medication, duration of use, and\\npotential management of side effects [ 173].\\nPatient Perspectives\\nJust as providers should listen to patients’\\nexperiences of invisible symptoms as part of the\\nshared decision-making process, patients can\\nparticipate in this process by openly describing\\nall symptoms to their provider, sharing priori-\\nties regarding treatment options, and actively\\nengaging in the management of their invisible\\nsymptoms. In doing so, people living with MS\\ncan inform providers about their unique expe-\\nrience and learn the self-management strategies\\nthat work well for them [ 174]. This involves\\nimplementing tactics that maintain overall\\nhealth and support well-being, including\\nattending regular preventive medical visits\\n(Fig. 3). People living with MS can also take\\nsteps to maintain their psychosocial well-being\\nby seeking out social supports that enhance\\nstigma mitigation (Fig. 3). Through self-em-\\npowered choices, such as incorporating an\\nexercise regimen tailored to their individual\\npreferences, people living with MS can support\\ntheir speciﬁc health needs (Fig. 3).\\nPatients can utilize various tools to track\\ntheir symptoms, increase the odds of obtaining\\ncare for their invisible symptoms, and facilitate\\ndiscussions with HCPs. Arriving at appoint-\\nments with notes of items to discuss can\\nincrease the likelihood that all concerns are\\naddressed. People living with MS can use a\\njournal or mobile applications (‘‘apps’’) to doc-\\nument symptoms between appointments, keep\\nnotes, and share information with their care\\nteam. Apps have become increasingly sophisti-\\ncated and specialized in recent years, with\\noptions available not only to monitor symp-\\ntoms but to manage them as well [ 175–177].\\nSome apps are dedicated to speciﬁc invisible\\nsymptoms, such as fatigue (MS Energise) or\\ncognition (NeuroNation) [ 175]. Personal ﬁtness\\ntrackers may also be useful for monitoring\\nactivity levels and planning wellness practices.\\nSuch technology can assist people living with\\nMS in providing data to the HCP that will allow\\nthe MS care team to arrive at conclusions about\\ninvisible symptoms based on the patients’ day-\\nto-day realities. HCPs may also use insights\\ngained from this external data to engage in\\ndiscussions with the person living with MS as\\npart of the shared decision-making process.\\nOnline resources are also available to guide\\npatients as they educate themselves about\\nmanaging their invisible symptoms. For exam-\\nple, the organization Overcoming Multiple\\nSclerosis offers tools to inform both patients\\nand providers about MS, including guides and\\nresources for implementing lifestyle changes\\n(e.g., recipes, guided meditations, and exercises)\\nand community-building opportunities [ 178].\\nMany patient advocacy groups, such as the\\nNational MS Society, also offer resources online\\nto support both people living with MS and their\\nfamilies [ 179].

There is a high likeli-\\nhood that people living with MS are\\nexperiencing invisible symptoms, and when\\nunaddressed, these symptoms have a detri-\\nmental effect on other symptoms of MS and on\\nQoL. Invisible symptoms can have long-lasting\\nimpacts on a patient’s mental health, relation-\\nships, and career, due not only to the physical\\npain/discomfort that they cause, but also to\\ntheir associated social stigma. Therefore, HCPs\\nmay consider proactively discussing invisible\\nsymptoms with patients and routinely utilizing\\nscreening tools. These actions signal to patients\\nthat the invisible symptoms they are experi-\\nencing are a normal component of life with MS\\nand aid in the de-stigmatization of seeking care.\\nWhen invisible symptoms are identiﬁed, HCPs\\nmay monitor them, discuss management\\noptions, and refer to an appropriate specialist as\\nneeded. Members of the care team should be\\naligned in the understanding that each patient\\nis unique and must be sincerely listened to in\\norder to ensure they have the support that they\\nneed/desire.\\nEmpowering patients and providers alike to\\naddress the impact of invisible symptoms on\\noverall QoL, and possibly disease progression,\\nbegins with increasing knowledge and closing\\ncommunication gaps. A team-based, shared\\ndecision-making approach to MS care can unite\\npeople living with MS and their HCPs as they\\nstrive to accomplish those shared objectives.\\nDue to the many stressors inherent in living\\nwith MS, this comprehensive care paradigm\\nshould include mental health professionals\\nwhen an interdisciplinary team is needed,\\nwhich we further explore in a companion\\nreview of mental health and MS [ 36]. By work-\\ning to build trusting relationships between all\\nmembers of the MS care team, HCPs can\\nincrease the odds of effective shared decision-\\nmaking with their patients. Apps, digital guides,\\nand online support groups can also serve as\\nuseful resources for managing invisible symp-\\ntoms and building community—and can be as\\nsimple as using one’s phone, and seeking out\\nspecialist care as needed. By giving a voice to\\npatients’ concerns and supporting the ongoing\\ndevelopment of innovative ways HCPs can\\nappropriately address invisible symptoms, MS\\ncare teams can offer people living with MS the\\nbest chance for maintaining a high QoL.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nOur provider authors wish to thank their\\npatients for all they have taught them about\\nliving with multiple sclerosis.

In the \\nmajority of cases, the progression supervenes after a \\nvariable latency from the onset of the relapsing remit-\\nting phase, but the clinical boundaries between the \\nrelapsing and the progressive course are often indis-\\ntinct. There are no surrogate markers or universally \\naccepted definition for the continuous unremitting \\ndisability accumulation and defining the clinical phe-\\nnotypes of MS can be challenging even for experi-\\nenced clinicians.\\nThe current phenotypical distinction of relapsing \\nremitting (RR), secondary progressive (SP) and pri-\\nmary progressive (PP) MS provides a standardized \\nterminology, which enhances homogeneity in clini-\\ncal trials. However, despite the variable patterns of \\nevolution, there are no biological reasons for discern-\\ning different phenotypes. Pathological mechanisms \\nunderlying acute attacks and progression are known \\nto be tightly intermingled and to occur concomitantly \\nsince the early phase of the disease, irrespective of \\nclinical symptoms. The same wide spectrum of cen-\\ntral nervous system tissue alterations is seen across \\nall stages, with only quantitative, rather than qualita-\\ntive differences.1 Both PP and SP MS share similar \\npathological features in respect of the extent of \\ninflammatory infiltrates, axonal damage and cortical \\ndemyelination.1 Epidemiological data corroborate a \\nunifying disease model of MS, with predominantly \\nage-related clinical phenotypes. By growing older, \\nthe risk of experiencing a progressive course propor-\\ntionally increases, while relapses gradually become \\nsparse and infrequent.2 Progressive MS patients, with \\nor without a preceding RR course, accumulate disa-\\nbility at very similar rate and share strikingly similar \\nmean age at onset of progression, indicating that \\nPPMS is preceded by an ‘asymptomatic RR phase’.3 \\nConsistent with this view, subjects with radiologi-\\ncally isolated syndrome can develop a PP course \\nyears after the incidental detection of white matter \\nabnormalities, confirming a protracted pre-progres-\\nsive prodrome with subclinical disease activity simi-\\nlar to RRMS.4\\nDespite being biologically active, progressive MS \\ncan remain clinically undetectable for years. Most \\nclinicians would be reluctant to document a progres-\\nsive accumulation of disability unrelated to clinical \\nattacks during the early stage of the RR phase. Based \\non the recently proposed objective definition of \\nSPMS, the attainment of at least expanded disability \\nstatus scale (EDSS) of 4 is required to mark the tran-\\nsition to the progressive phase.5 However, the clini-\\ncal progression can be uncovered in the early phase \\nof the disease, among patients with no permanent \\nmotor impairment, especially when relapses with \\npoor recovery, which can potentially cloud the pro-\\ngressive accumulation of disability, are uncommon. \\nThis was highlighted by George Ebers’ group by \\naddressing the clinical course of single attack pro-\\ngressive MS, which is a rare phenotype distinguished \\nby a single demyelinating  episode at onset, followed \\nsome years later by the progressive phase. Because \\nof the lack of ongoing relapses, in this subgroup, the \\nprogression mostly presented clinically with exer-\\ncise-induced ambulation worsening and could be \\npinpointed after 8 mean years from onset, at an aver-\\nage EDSS of 2, therefore much earlier than in classic \\nSPMS cases.6\\nIn line with these early intuitive observations, recent \\ndata indicate that a continuous progression independ-\\nent of relapsing activity (PIRA) is commonly observed \\nduring the RR phase. The pooled analysis of the two \\nOPERA trials demonstrated, in both the Interferon \\nand Ocrelizumab groups with a relatively short dis-\\nease duration (mean 6 years) and low baseline mean \\nEDSS score (= 2.8), an impressively large proportion \\nof patients (78% and 87%, respectively) accumulat-\\ning disability, which was unrelated to inflammatory \\nattacks and was mostly secondary to worsening of the \\nwalking impairment.7 This provides clinical evidence \\nof an early underlying progressive course despite the \\nMS can be considered a primary  \\nprogressive disease in all cases, but some patients have superimposed relapses – Yes\\nAntonio Scalfari\\nCorrespondence to: \\nA Scalfari  \\nCentre of Neuroscience, \\nDepartment of Medicine, \\nImperial College London, \\nCharing Cross Hospital, \\nFulham Palace Road, London \\nW6 8RF, UK. \\na.scalfari@imperial.ac.uk\\nAntonio Scalfari  \\nCentre of Neuroscience, \\nDepartment of Medicine, \\nImperial College London, \\nCharing Cross Hospital, \\nLondon, UK\\n1001789 MSJ0010.1177/13524585211001789Multiple Sclerosis JournalA Scalfari\\nresearch-article20212021\\nControversies in Multiple Sclerosis\\n'),\n",

The adequate \\ncontrol of inflammatory parameters might provide a \\nsense of false security, while a continuous smoulder-\\ning process underpins the subtle clinical deterioration, \\nwhich stands out as an important unmet treatment tar-\\nget. Changes in the whole brain and grey matter vol-\\nume,7 the accumulation of chronic slowing expanding \\nlesions8 and the microglia activation, both in the nor -\\nmal appearing white matter and in the perilesional \\nareas,9 are plausible drivers of PIRA events during the \\nRR phase, when the focal inflammatory activity is the \\ndominant clinical feature, albeit representing only the \\ntip of the pathological iceberg.\\nThese observations challenge the dichotomy between \\nrelapsing and progressive disease, supporting a one \\nstage disorder model of MS, where all patients \\nexhibit a progressive course since the disease onset, \\nwhich can be overlapped by relapses. Detrimental \\nprocesses, spanning across all disease stages and \\nunderpinning the progressive accumulation of disa-\\nbility, start early and subtly emerge clinically under \\nthe strong influence of age-related biological \\nchanges, which induce immune senescence and \\nexhaustion of compensatory mechanisms.10 The indi-\\nvidual immune system proactivity accounts for the \\nsimultaneous highly variable superimposed relapsing \\nactivity, which overlaps the progressive course and \\nadditionally contributes to the disability accumula-\\ntion. In this wide spectrum of age-related clinical \\nmanifestations, young patients are more likely to \\nexperience relapse onset progressive MS and display \\nan initial floridly inflammatory course, which gradu-\\nally subsides by growing older, while the subclinical \\nneurodegeneration becomes clinically evident. At the \\nopposite extreme lay older patients, who present with \\na PP course and are distinguished by a resistance to \\nthe clinical inflammatory activity, possibly related to \\nundetermined immunological qualitative differences, \\ncompared to SPMS.\\nAlike other neurodegenerative disorders, such as \\nParkinson or Alzheimer diseases, progressive MS is \\npreceded by a prodromal phase of unknown duration \\nbefore meeting its conventional clinical definition. It \\nremains debated whether relapses represent a con-\\ncomitant epiphenomenon to the primary neuroaxonal \\nloss, which potentially promotes the release of highly \\nantigenic myelin fragments, secondarily triggering \\nthe innate and adaptive immune responses. This \\ninside-out model would contrast with the traditional \\noutside-in view of a primary process, starting in the \\nperiphery with a dysregulated immune reaction and \\ncausing an inflammatory response, which eventually \\nlead to the axonal degeneration. The tight intercon-\\nnection between neurodegenerative and inflammatory \\nmechanisms makes the two hypotheses equally likely, \\nleaving the question unresolved. However, evidence \\nof early progressive accumulation of disability inde-\\npendent of relapses discloses a dissociation between \\nthe therapeutic suppression of the inflammatory activ-\\nity and the disease progression. This highlights the \\nneed of shifting our treatments strategies to target \\nmore broadly all pathological mechanisms driving \\nMS, with a specific focus on halting smouldering pro-\\ncesses, which account for the progressive worsening \\nsince the early stage.\\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\\nThe author declared the following potential conflicts \\nof interest with respect to the research, authorship, \\nand/or publication of this article: Dr Scalfari received \\nhonoraria for participations to advisory board and \\nconference attendances from Teva, Biogen, Novartis, \\nSanofi-Genzyme, Roche and Celgene.\\nFunding\\nThe author received no financial support for the \\nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this \\narticle.\\nORCID iD\\nAntonio Scalfari  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7757 \\n-0293\\nReferences\\n 1.

It also implies the steady loss of axons \\nwithin the central nervous system (CNS), most fre-\\nquently associated with an impairment in ambulation. \\nThe reasons for the progressive axonal loss are not \\nfully known but likely to be multifactorial.\\nWe contend that not all multiple sclerosis (MS) is pro-\\ngressive from the beginning. Extrapolating this stance, \\nwe argue that not all people with MS have a steady loss \\nof CNS axons beyond what occurs naturally with aging \\nor in association with relapses. The other side of this \\ndebate might argue that progressive MS can be \\nobscured by overlying relapses and by neuroplasticity. \\nWe base our stance that progressive MS is not present \\nfrom MS initiation in all people with MS upon the fol-\\nlowing pillars: (1) clinical cases of bona fide “benign” \\nMS lasting for decades and (2) imaging evidence of \\nnon-progression in some persons with MS.\\nAlthough identifying benign MS before the requisite \\ndecades of follow-up remains controversial, benign MS \\nundoubtedly exists.\\n1 We argue that benign MS would \\nnot exist in a substantial proportion if all people with \\nMS have underlying progressive MS, even accounting \\nfor possible periods of quiescence. The Multiple \\nSclerosis Severity Score was based on the Expanded \\nDisability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of 9892 primarily \\nEuropean MS patients in relation to their disease dura-\\ntions.2 These MS patients were being followed at \\ndedicated MS centers, suggesting that the majority had \\nthe correct diagnosis of MS. The average disease dura-\\ntion of the patients in the study was 11.7 years. The \\nstudy included several hundred people with 15 or more \\nyears duration of MS, 25% of whom had EDSS of 2.5 \\nor less, which is close to a normal neurological exami-\\nnation. Over 200 people were followed more than \\n20 years. Even after 20 years disease duration, 15% had \\nan EDSS of 2.5 or lower. These proportions were simi-\\nlar to those derived in a London Ontario MS cohort,3 \\nsupporting their veracity and the existence of a popula-\\ntion of MS patients with long-standing, minimally \\naltered neurological examinations.\\nIn the United States, the New York State MS \\nConsortium (NYSMSC) reported a retrospective study \\nof over 6000 persons with MS, and observed that \\n19.8% of NYSMSC patients qualified as benign.4 A \\nconservative definition of EDSS ⩽ 2 with ⩾ 10 years \\nduration since symptom onset was adopted and the \\nmean duration since symptom onset was 17 ± 6.7 years. \\nWe argue that it is difficult to reconcile cases of MS \\nthat remain without significant disability accumulation \\nfor 15 or 20 years as having underlying progressive dis-\\nease even after accounting for neuroplasticity.\\nSome may argue that benign MS does not adequately \\ncapture all types of impairment due to its reliance on \\nthe EDSS and ambulation.

Nonetheless, in our\\nrecently reported prospective cohort, more than half of patients with relapsing MS accumulated signiﬁcant new disabil-\\nity by the 10th year of follow-up. Notably,“no evidence of disease activity” at 2 years did not predict long-term stabil-\\nity. Here, we determined to what extent clinical relapses and radiographic evidence of disease activity contribute to\\nlong-term disability accumulation.\\nMethods:Disability progression was deﬁned as an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.5, 1.0, or 0.5\\n(or greater) from baseline EDSS = 0, 1.0–5.0, and 5.5 or higher, respectively, assessed from baseline to year 5 (/C6 1y e a r )\\nand sustained to year 10 (/C6 1 year). Longitudinal analysis of relative brain volume loss used a linear mixed model with sex,\\nage, disease duration, andHLA-DRB1*15:01 as covariates.\\nResults: Relapses were associated with a transient increase in disability over 1-year intervals (p = 0.012) but not with\\nconﬁrmed disability progression (p = 0.551). Relative brain volume declined at a greater rate among individuals with\\ndisability progression compared to those who remained stable (p < 0.05).\\nInterpretation: Long-term worsening is common in relapsing MS patients, is largely independent of relapse activity,\\nand is associated with accelerated brain atrophy.

We\\nsought to test the 2-stage hypothesis of disability progression\\nby deﬁning the contribution of relapses and radiographic dis-\\nease activity to long-term disability and brain atrophy using\\na well-phenotyped, University of California, San Francisco\\n(UCSF) MS-EPIC (expression/genomics, proteomics, imag-\\ning, and clinical) dataset.\\nThe MS-EPIC dataset is a single-center prospective\\nobservational cohort of contemporary, actively treated MS\\npatients who have been evaluated annually since July 2004\\nwith long-term data ascertained in 91% of study partici-\\npants. We previously reported that rates of worsening and\\nevolution to secondary progressive MS (SPMS) were sub-\\nstantially lower when compared to natural history studies\\nfrom the pretreatment era. Nonetheless, more than half of\\npatients with relapsing MS accumulated signiﬁcant new dis-\\nability after 1 decade of follow-up.26 Notably, no evidence\\nof disease activity (NEDA) at 2 years did not predict long-\\nterm stability. Because over half of the relapsing–remitting\\n(RRMS) patients in the EPIC dataset developed clinically\\nsigniﬁcant disability worsening by 10 years, but were still\\nconsidered by their treating physicians to have relapsing\\nMS (ie, they had not been reclassiﬁed as having developed\\nsecondary progressive disease), we sought to determine\\nwhether ongoing relapse activity, assessed clinically as\\nrelapses or radiographically as new or enlarging focal white\\nmatter lesions, might be the primary contributor to this\\nlong-term disability worsening. We also sought to deter-\\nmine to what extent relapsing activity contributes to evolu-\\ntion of brain atrophy— an in vivo measure of irreversible\\ntissue injury that correlates with long-term disability.\\nPatients and Methods\\nThe UCSF EPIC cohort is a prospective, longitudinal,\\nactively treated, single-center cohort of patients, now in its\\n14th year of follow-up. The UCSF Institutional Review\\nBoard reviewed and approved the study protocol. Written\\ninformed consent was obtained for all participants. This\\nstudy was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of\\nHelsinki. The 10-year, postbaseline follow-up of this cohort\\nwas previously reported.26 Although the cohort enrolled par-\\nticipants with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), RRMS,\\nSPMS, and primary progressive MS, here we considered\\nonly those participants who had either CIS or RRMS at\\nentry. For baseline data, the annualized relapse rate (ARR;\\nlife-time) was calculated from when theﬁrst relapse occurred\\nto baseline in the patient self-reported database. At end of\\nstudy, the ARR was calculated from baseline to last visit. If\\nmissing data were due to MS disability in Multiple Sclerosis\\nFunctional Composite (MSFC) assessment, then 99 seconds\\nwas used in the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), 300 sec-\\no n d sw a su s e di nt h e9 - H o l eP e gT e s t( 9 H P T ) ,a n d0s c o r e s\\nwere used for the 3-second Paced Auditory Serial Addition\\nTest (PASAT) and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test\\n(SDMT). R median algorithm (type 7) was used to calculate\\nmedian and interquartile scores. Some patients had partial\\nvisits due to missing MSFC at last follow-up. In this case,\\nthe most recent available MSFC visit was used.\\nAs previously reported,26 clinically signiﬁcant disability\\nwas deﬁned as worsening by an increase in the Expanded\\nDisability Status Scale (EDSS)27 of 1.5 points if the baseline\\nEDSS score was 0, 1.0 point if the baseline EDSS score was\\nbetween 1.0 and 5.0, and 0.5 point for baseline EDSS\\nscores of 5.5 or higher. Relapses were patient-reported and\\nassessed systematically for the year prior at each annual visit.\\nRelapses were deﬁned as new, focal neurological symptoms\\nevolving over days to weeks that lasted for >24 hours, were\\nnot associated with an intercurrent infection, and were typi-\\ncally followed by at least partial recovery of function over\\ntime. Examples of relapses included vision loss, double vision,\\nweakness in one or more limbs, sensory disturbances includ-\\ning paresthesias, or loss of coordination including imbalance.\\nSymptoms that were nonspeciﬁc such as headache, malaise,\\nand generalized weakness or were insidious and progressive in\\nnature were not considered relapses.

As such, each sub-\\nject was considered serially for annual assessment of the\\nimpact of relapses on MS disability. Conﬁrmed disability was\\ndeﬁned as worsening maintained for 2 consecutive annual\\nvisits. Lastly, long-term worsening was deﬁned as increase in\\ndisability between baseline and the midpoint of the study\\n(median years = 5, range = 4–6), with conﬁrmation of wors-\\nening 5 years thereafter (sustained worsening).\\nDisability was also assessed using the T25FW, 9HPT,\\nand PASAT. Because the SDMT became generally available\\nfor MS studies during the course of the study, this test of\\ncognitive function was performed after the 5th study year.\\nClinically meaningful worsening was deﬁned as a 20%\\nincrease in the T25FW (average of 2 trials), a 20% increase\\nin the 9HPT time for either arm (single trial), an increase in\\nthe reliable change index for the PASAT, and a 4-point\\nworsening in the SDMT. The contribution of relapse to dis-\\nability was determined by Pearson chi-squared test with\\nYates continuity correction or Fisher exact test.\\nTo simplify the analysis of treatment on relapses, we\\ngrouped therapies into 2 tiers:“platform” (eg, interferons,\\nglatiramer acetate) and“high-potency therapy”(eg, natalizumab,\\nmitoxantrone, rituximab, cyclophosphamide).26 We also consid-\\nered a 3-tiered model grouping together therapies by relative\\nrelapse rate reduction: modest (interferons, glatiramer ace-\\ntate, teriﬂunomide), moderate (ﬁngolimod, dimethyl fu-\\nmarate), and high (natalizumab, anti-CD20 monoclonal\\nantibodies, alemtuzumab) efﬁcacy. However, because oral\\ntreatment options and other monoclonal antibodies were not\\ngenerally available during theﬁrst 6 years of the study, we\\npresent the simpler, 2-tiered model. Multivariate logistic\\nregression was used to model the impact of treatment tier on\\nrelapses, with disease duration, disease course, andHLA-\\nDRB1*15:01 included as covariates.HLA-DRB1*15:01 was\\nincluded in this and other analyses because we previously\\nreported an effect of this allele on certain clinical features of\\nMS.28,29 Age-adjusted baseline brain volume was calculated\\nby regression (baseline brain volume ~ age + sex + disease\\nduration) and was divided into quartiles. Logistic regression\\nwas used to assess relationships between long-term disability\\nworsening and age-adjusted brain volume. A linear mixed\\nmodel was developed to consider the impact of relapses and\\ndisability worsening on relative brain volume loss. Four\\nsubject groups were considered: (1) participants with\\nincreased disability but without relapses, (2) participants\\nwithout increased disability and without relapses, (3) partici-\\npants with increased disability and with relapses, and\\n(4) participants without increased disability but with\\nrelapses. The annual percentage change in relative brain vol-\\nume is deﬁned as the slope of follow-up year divided by the\\nrelative brain volume at baseline. If brain volume is a0 and\\ncerebrospinalﬂuid (CSF) is b0 at time 0, and brain volume is\\na10 and CSF is b10 at time 10, then the percentage change of\\nbrain volume is (a10 − a0)/1 0/a 0 = a10−a0\\n10a0 . The percent\\nchange of relative brain volume is (a10 /[ a10 +b 10] − a0 /\\n[a0 +b 0]) / 10 / (a0 /[ a0 +b 0]) = a10b0−a0b10\\n10a0 a10 + b10ðÞ . The ratio of\\npercentage change of brain volume to the percentage\\nchange of relative brain volume is (a10 − a0)(a10 +b 10)/\\n(a10b0 − a0b10). In this dataset, the ratio of relative brain vol-\\nume to percentage change in brain volume is 5- to 6-fold.\\nTo assess the effect of new brain lesions on silent pro-\\ngression and on brain atrophy in treated and untreated partici-\\npants, 4 subgroups were identiﬁed: (1) treated participants\\nwithout new lesions (new T2 or Gd+), (2) treated participants\\nwith new lesions, (3) untreated participants without new\\nlesions, and (4) untreated participants with new lesions. Logis-\\ntic regression was used to identify inﬂuences on disability and\\na linear mixed model for brain atrophy.\\nThe MRI acquisition protocol and analytic pipelines\\nwere previously published.26 Brieﬂy, Lesion Segmentation\\nTool30 was used to segment lesion onﬂuid-attenuated inver-\\nsion recovery images and corrected using the Mind Control\\nplatform.31 These lesions were used as input to SIENAX32\\nusing optibet33 for brain extraction. Registration and multi-\\nnormal segmentation methods were used to propagate\\nlesions backward and forward within a subject over time\\n(unpublished methods). Gadolinium-enhancing lesions were\\nvisually assessed on postcontrast T1-weighted MRI. Gado-\\nlinium was not routinely administered for all brain MRI\\nstudies at long-term follow-up.\\nResults\\nRelapses Are Associated with Short-Term but\\nNot Conﬁrmed or Long-Term Disability\\nWorsening\\nThe baseline characteristics of this cohort are described in\\nTable 1.

At baseline, a signi ﬁcant\\neffect on relative brain volume loss was observed only in\\nthe group of subjects with worsening disability and relapses.\\nAge at baseline, disease duration at baseline, male sex, and\\nyears of follow-up were all associated with decline in relative\\nbrain volume loss. The interaction term of subject group\\nwith years of observation in the study was signiﬁcant for all\\n3 groups relative to the reference group of clinically stable\\nparticipants (without disability worsening and without\\nrelapses). This interaction term indicates that each subject\\ngroup modiﬁes the impact of time on relative brain volume\\nloss. That the interaction terms for all groups relative to clini-\\ncally stable patients (those without worsening disability and\\nwithout relapses) was signiﬁcant indicates that patient group\\nmodiﬁes the effect of time on relative brain volume loss.\\nTherefore, the rates of relative brain volume loss for partici-\\npants with either relapses or increasing disability are signiﬁ-\\ncantly greater than the rate found in clinically quiescent\\nparticipants (Fig 3, Table 5). Signiﬁcant differences were\\nfound for comparisons between the“stable disability without\\nrelapse”and “increased disability without relapse,”“increased\\ndisability with relapse,” and “stable disability with relapse”\\ngroups, but no differences were observed for other compari-\\nsons. The most statistically signiﬁcant comparison is for the\\ngroup of subjects who experienced increased disability with-\\nout relapse in comparison to the group of subjects who were\\nclinically stable. Nonsigniﬁcant p values suggest that there is\\nno difference between the 2 groups being compared on rates\\nof relative brain volume loss. Although relapses may contrib-\\nute to relative brain volume loss in subjects without increas-\\ning disability (p = 0.027), there was no apparent additional\\nimpact of relapses in the group of subjects with worsening\\ndisability (p = 0.486). Similarly, there was no apparent addi-\\ntional impact of increased disability in the group of subjects\\nwith relapses (p = 0.999).\\nThe baseline brain parenchymal fraction was not sig-\\nniﬁcantly different between the 4 groups, and, over the\\ncourse of the study, brain volume declined in each group.\\nIn considering the group of patients who did not experi-\\nence relapses during theﬁrst 6 years of the study, relative\\nbrain volume declined at a more pronounced rate in partic-\\nipants whose disability progressed compared to those who\\nremained stable (see Fig 3).

Moreover,\\nduring the relapsing phase, disability measures are con-\\nfounded by clinical attacks followed by variable recovery.\\nAll of these factors can obscure recognition of an underly-\\ning neurodegenerative process that we labeledsilent progres-\\nsion to highlight its subtle emergence over the course of\\nRRMS. It seems likely that the same underlying process\\nthat causes silent progression is responsible for SPMS when\\nthe march of clinical worsening is more evident. In this\\nregard, it is notable that patients experiencing silent pro-\\ngression had accelerated brain atrophy over the long-term\\ncourse of the EPIC study, as well as more age-adjusted\\nbrain atrophy at the time of their initial enrollment.\\nOur data are consistent with 2 simultaneous pro-\\ncesses; one results in the appearance of new focal demye-\\nlinating lesions visible on brain MRI that correlate with\\nrelapses, and the other is more diffuse and contributes to\\nbrain atrophy. This second process of global tissue injury\\nis largely independent of relapses or focal lesion formation\\nand appears to represent the most important contributor\\nto long-term MS disability. That brain volume loss occurs\\nearly in MS and correlates with long-term disability was\\nshown in prior studies.35–37 However, uncertainty remains\\nas to whether this process is dependent or independent of\\nthe development of new focal lesions. Because we found\\nno correlation of new brain MRI lesions with long-term\\ndisability, our data are more consistent with the hypothe-\\nsis that either diffuse injury or perhaps focal lesions too\\nsmall to be detected by current methods lead to irrevers-\\nible tissue loss.\\nThe pathologic substrate responsible for progressive tis-\\nsue injury in MS is likely to result from some combination of\\na white matter axonopathy and direct neuronal injury. Slowly\\nenlarging white matter lesions associated with chronic inﬂam-\\nmation at the leading edge is one possible mechanism for pro-\\ngressive symptoms, and more diffuse injury might also play a\\nrole.38 Histopathological studies in chronic MS show that focal\\ninﬂammatory changes, microglial activation, and astrocytosis\\ntypically accompany axonopathy and myelin injury.39–41\\nFurthermore, chronic demyelination appears to predispose\\naxons to early death.42 In addition, ectopic B-cell–containing\\nimmune aggregates located in the overlying meninges and in\\nVirchow–Robin perivascular spaces could contribute to pro-\\ngressive cortical injury. Thus, histopathological studies support\\na model in which both microscopic and macroscopic tissue\\ninjury occur with CNS inﬂammation.\\nThese data also indicate that silent progression is not an\\ninvariable accompaniment of RRMS, and that measurement\\nof whole brain atrophy might serve as a surrogate marker to\\nidentify patients with insidiously progressive ongoing disabil-\\nity. Incorporating a threshold for preservation of brain volume\\nwas proposed as a component for no evidence of disease activ-\\nity (NEDA-4).43 For ﬁngolimod-treated patients, incorporat-\\ning a minimal acceptable threshold for preservation of brain\\nvolume reduced the proportion of patients meeting the\\nNEDA criteria from 31% for NEDA-3 to 19.7% for\\nNEDA-4, underscoring the remaining unmet need for thera-\\npies that are more effective in arresting axonopathy and brain\\nvolume loss than current treatments.\\nRegulatory agencies have approved more than a dozen\\ntherapies for treatment of RRMS. All are proven, with vary-\\ning degrees of efﬁcacy, to reduce the occurrence of clinical\\nrelapses and prevent development of focal lesions measured\\non brain MRI. For the most part, the selection of which\\ntreatment to use is based on these measures of efﬁcacy as\\nwell as consideration of safety and tolerability. Our observa-\\ntion that tissue injury distinct from focal white matter\\nlesions underlies long-term disability in RRMS suggests that\\ntreatment selection should also consider the impact on silent\\nprogression and on associated measures of brain atrophy.\\nImportantly, recent studies indicate that the high-efﬁcacy\\ntherapies natalizumab44 and ocrelizumab45 reduce progres-\\nsion independent of relapse activity in RRMS, although\\nthese effects were partial. Additional studies are needed to\\ndetermine whether long-term beneﬁts on disability preven-\\ntion are mediated by prevention of brain volume loss.\\nOur conclusions in regard to the impact of relapses on\\nlong-term disability are consistent with those from the British\\nColumbia cohort7 but appear to diverge from the observations\\nfrom MSBase.13 O n ee x p l a n a t i o nf o rt h i sd i f f e r e n c ec o u l db e\\nsample size. The MSBase group drew their conclusions from\\na larger dataset of 2,466 relapsing onset participants and has\\ngreater power to detect predictors of long-term disability with\\nsmall effect sizes. However, advantages of the current EPIC\\nstudy are its prospective ascertainment, systematic MRI acqui-\\nsition and analysis, and a high rate of retention that reduces\\nthe impact of bias introduced by missing information from\\nparticipants lost to follow-up. The mean annual relapse\\nfrequency was slightly higher in MSBase than EPIC (0.36\\ncompared with 0.25,p < 0.001), possibly increasing the long-\\nterm effect of attacks on disability. Differences in prescribing\\npractice between these datasets could also play a role, as treat-\\nment likely inﬂuences not only relapse frequency but also\\nrelapse severity. The methods used for assessing the impact of\\nrelapses on long-term disability between these 2 studies are\\nalso different; in EPIC we used a minimal threshold for dis-\\nability worsening from our baseline observation and correlated\\nrelapse occurrence with both short-term and long-term dis-\\nability worsening, whereas MSBase used a linear-regression\\nmodel that considered the impact of the ARR over the\\n10 years of study on median 10-year EDSS change.\\nMay 2019 663\\nCree et al.: Disability in Relapsing MS'),\n",

Participants in this study had higher\\nrelapse rates (1.2 ARR) and baseline EDSS scores (3.0),\\nindicating that this cohort was more clinically active and\\nhad worse disability compared to the EPIC dataset. At the\\ntime of the pivotal interferonβ-1b trial, therapeutic\\noptions for escalation treatment were limited. Perhaps\\neven more importantly, these studies used different ana-\\nlytic methods: the interferonβ-1b long-term follow-up\\nstudy assessed whether the ARR during theﬁrst 2 years of\\nthe study correlated with increased EDSS by year 16.\\nWhen relapses have been correlated with long-term dis-\\nability, their impact typically was observed primarily during\\nthe ﬁrst 2 to 5 years from disease onset.8–12 With earlier diag-\\nnosis of MS based on evolving diagnostic criteria and hence\\nearlier treatment, it seems likely that many patients with high\\nrelapse frequency would be treated with disease-modifying\\ntherapies, thereby attenuating the association between early\\nfrequent relapses and long-term disability. Given that the\\nmean disease duration at baseline in the EPIC dataset was\\n7.6 years (see Table 1), the majority of the observations\\nregarding relapses in this dataset occur after theﬁrst 5 years of\\ndisease onset. Therefore, due to differences in the windows of\\nobservation, ourﬁnding that relapses do not contribute to\\nlong-term disability may be consistent with these prior studies.\\nLastly, ourﬁndings should not be interpreted to suggest that\\nMS relapses are without clinical signiﬁcance. Within this\\ndataset, in addition to the impact of relapses on short-term\\ndisability, there are circumstances in which severe relapses cau-\\nsed permanent disability (data not shown). Rather, our results\\nargue that long-term disability in RRMS is not primarily\\ndriven by cumulative injury from relapses.\\nOur study has several limitations. We were not able\\nto identify a statistically signiﬁcant impact of treatment on\\nlong-term disability or brain volume loss; however, this\\ndataset is likely underpowered to detect small treatment\\neffects mediated through reduction of new white matter\\nlesions detected by MRI. In addition to the relatively small\\nsize of our dataset, information on relapses was patient-\\nreported and thus is not directly comparable to clinician-\\nvalidated relapses obtained from controlled clinical trials.\\nIn the clinical trial setting, participants are assessed within a\\ndeﬁned window of relapse onset, and relapses are deﬁned by\\nan objective change in EDSS score. Such rigorous relapse\\nassessment was beyond the scope of our study, which was\\ndesigned for long-term characterization of the MS phenotype.\\nWe therefore relied on patient-reported relapses that were\\nassessed through structured interview. When our participants\\nwere clustered by factor analysis of mixed data (see Fig 2), par-\\nticipants with the same relapse frequency grouped together,\\nsuggesting validity of self-reported relapses. Moreover, in the\\nCombiRx study, the impact of treatment on patient-reported\\nrelapses was similar to that of protocol-deﬁned relapses,\\nsuggesting that patient-reported relapses are likely valid.47\\nAnother potential limitation is the possibility that focal gray\\nmatter lesions or spinal cord lesions, not quantiﬁed in this\\nstudy, could contribute to long-term disability. Finally, results\\nobtained from any single-center design may not be replicated\\nin other datasets. Work is underway to address this issue; we\\nhave partnered with other groups who have similar deeply\\nphenotyped long-term datasets for the purpose of increasing\\nstatistical power and performing validation studies for these\\nand other observations.48 Despite these limitations, the char-\\nacteristics of this dataset are consistent with previously publi-\\nshed observations in that MS relapses were associated with\\nnew lesions on brain MRI and were associated with increased\\nshort-term MS disability.2,3 The consistency of ourﬁndings\\nregarding short-term outcomes lends credence to our longer-\\nterm observations.\\nIn summary, the high degree of effectiveness of MS\\ntherapies against clinical attacks and new white matter lesions\\nmade it possible to prospectively assess long-term outcomes in\\nRRMS when these elements of focal disease were silenced.\\nThe appearance of silent progression during the RRMS phase\\nand its association with brain atrophy suggest that the same\\nprocess that underlies SPMS likely begins far earlier than is\\ngenerally recognized and support a unitary view of MS biol-\\nogy, with both focal and diffuse tissue destructive components,\\nand with inﬂammation and neurodegeneration occurring\\nthroughout the disease spectrum.In addition to brain atrophy,\\nother markers of neural degeneration, such as quantitative spi-\\nnal cord imaging,49 optical coherence tomography,50 and\\nserum neuroﬁlament light chains,51 may also prove useful in\\nidentifying patients with silent progression. Moreover, as\\nrelapses and focal white matter lesions are brought under\\nexcellent control by disease-modifying therapies for RRMS,\\nthe effectiveness of these agents against silent progression is\\nlikely to represent a key determinant of their relative value.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n(R01NS26799 to S.L.H. and J.R.O.), the Valhalla Founda-\\ntion, and gifts from Friends of the Multiple Sclerosis\\nResearch Group at UCSF supported this study.\\nWe thank the patients for their long-term participa-\\ntion in this ambitious study and A.

To this end, such patients exhibit \\ndisability progression despite being relapse-free \\nand exhibiting neither contrast-enhancing \\nT1-weighted (T1w) lesions nor new or enlarging \\nT2-weighted (T2w) lesions on magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI). This is often referred to as \\nprogression independent of relapse activity \\n(PIRA) or smouldering MS,1 which is distinct \\nfrom relapse-associated worsening (RAW; see \\nFigure 1 for definitions). Based on a synthesis of \\npathology, neuroimaging, and clinical data, we \\npropose that the ‘real MS’ is likely to be driven by \\na primary smouldering process accompanied by a \\nsuperimposed inflammatory activity that poten-\\ntially represents the host immune response to \\nunderlying causes of the disease.2 Overwhelming \\nevidence from MRI and pathological studies indi-\\ncate that the progressive neuroaxonal loss that \\nunderpins the accumulation of unremitting disa-\\nbility is present from the very early stages of the \\ndisease.3–6 From a biological perspective, this \\nwould imply a continuum between the relapsing \\nand progressive stages of MS, which are distin-\\nguished only by quantitative rather than qualita-\\ntive pathological differences.7 What we see \\nclinically is an interplay between the effects of \\nSmouldering multiple sclerosis: the ‘real MS’\\nGavin Giovannoni , Veronica Popescu, Jens Wuerfel, Kerstin Hellwig, Ellen Iacobaeus, \\nMichael B.

We provide a range of evidence \\nto argue that the ‘real MS’ is in fact driven primarily by a smouldering pathological disease \\nprocess. In natural history studies and clinical trials, relapses and focal activity revealed \\nby magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in MS patients on placebo or on disease-modifying \\ntherapies (DMTs) were found to be poor predictors of long-term disease evolution and were \\ndissociated from disability outcomes. In addition, the progressive accumulation of disability \\nin MS can occur independently of relapse activity from early in the disease course. This \\nscenario is underpinned by a more diffuse smouldering pathological process that may affect \\nthe entire CNS. Many putative pathological drivers of smouldering MS can be potentially \\nmodified by specific therapeutic strategies, an approach that may have major implications \\nfor the management of MS patients. We hypothesise that therapeutically targeting a state \\nof ‘no evident inflammatory disease activity’ (NEIDA) cannot sufficiently prevent disability \\naccumulation in MS, meaning that treatment should also focus on other brain and spinal cord \\npathological processes contributing to the slow loss of neurological function. This should \\nalso be complemented with a holistic approach to the management of other systemic disease \\nprocesses that have been shown to worsen MS outcomes.\\nKeywords: multiple sclerosis, smouldering multiple sclerosis, progression independent of \\nrelapse activity, progressive multiple sclerosis\\nReceived: 12 August 2021; revised manuscript accepted: 28 November 2021.\\nCorrespondence to:  \\nGavin Giovannoni  \\nBlizard Institute, Barts \\nand The London School of \\nMedicine and Dentistry, \\nQueen Mary University \\nof London, 4 Newark St., \\nWhitechapel, London E1 \\n2AT, UK \\ng.giovannoni@qmul.ac.uk\\n \\nVeronica Popescu  \\nUniversitair MS Centrum, \\nHasselt, Belgium; \\nNoorderhart Hospital, \\nPelt, Belgium; Hasselt \\nUniversity, Hasselt, \\nBelgium\\nJens Wuerfel  \\nMIAC AG, Department of \\nBiomedical Engineering, \\nUniversity of Basel, Basel, \\nSwitzerland; Charité – \\nUniversity Medicine Berlin, \\nBerlin, Germany\\nKerstin Hellwig  \\nKatholisches Klinikum \\nBochum, Klinikum der \\nRuhr-Universität, Bochum, \\nGermany\\nEllen Iacobaeus  \\nKarolinska University \\nHospital, Stockholm, \\nSweden\\nMichael B.

It \\nremains to be determined whether the axonal \\nregrowth to restore lost function occurs in MS \\nlesions38 similarly to that observed in animals and \\nin the human peripheral nervous system; for \\nexample, in poliomyelitis, the sprouting of surviv-\\ning axons contributes to repair following a patho-\\nlogical insult.40 Therefore, it is plausible to \\nhypothesise that axonal sprouting primes neurons \\nto die off prematurely as a result of an excessive \\nmetabolic burden placed on the surviving axons.40\\nDemyelination\\nDemyelination and acute conduction block are \\nother factors contributing to focal deficits within \\ninflammatory lesions.41 Axonal plasticity or the \\nsynthesis and insertion of sodium channels along \\ndemyelinated axonal segments restores nerve \\nconduction, albeit at a much lower velocity and \\nwith a higher energy requirement.42 These demy-\\nelinated axonal segments have a reduced safety \\nfactor of conduction, making them more suscep-\\ntible to increased temperature or fatigue, and thus \\naccounting for intermittent but reversible symp-\\ntoms such as Uhthoff’s phenomenon.42 In addi-\\ntion, demyelinated axons are less resilient and \\nmore likely to die prematurely due to an excessive \\nmetabolic burden or from axonal excitotoxicity \\nstemming from the proinflammatory microenvi-\\nronment in MS lesions. Although remyelination \\nis well documented in MS, it is incomplete and \\nfails with age.43 As demyelinated axons are more \\nsusceptible to degeneration, the failure of remy-\\nelination in MS is likely to be one of the contrib-\\nuting factors to smouldering MS.44\\nMacrophage/microglial activation\\nActivation of microglia and recruited macrophages \\nare found in acute MS lesions and persists in \\nchronic active and inactive MS lesions. Activated \\nmicroglia produce proinflammatory cytokines and \\ninflammatory mediators, which are hypothesised \\nto drive both acute and chronic axonal loss. Focal \\nsmouldering inflammatory activity has been \\nreported in several MS lesion types, encompassing \\nchronic active/smouldering lesions and subpial \\ncortical lesions. At autopsy, 20–40% of white mat-\\nter lesions are categorised as slowly evolving \\nlesions (SELs).24 These are characterised by a low \\ndegree of inflammation and with T and B cells at \\nthe lesion core, a dense network of activated iron-\\nladen microglia/macrophages expressing the pro-\\ninflammatory markers CD68 and p22phox in a \\nglial wall, and by proliferating oligodendrocytes at \\nthe lesion edge.15,45–48 Microglial activation may \\nalso contribute to the failure of oligodendrocytes \\nto remyelinate neurons, an effect that may be \\ndependent on the stage of the lesions.49\\nIn contrast to other MS lesions, which have a ten-\\ndency to shrink in gliotic stages, SELs with para-\\nmagnetic rims of activated microglia at their edges \\ncontribute to the failure of remyelination, resulting \\nin further destruction of the surrounding paren-\\nchyma.50 The presence of SELs has been correlated \\nwith a more severe clinical outcome.50 In addition, \\npatients with heightened microglial activation, as \\ndetermined by the expression of 18 kDa transloca-\\ntor protein (TSPO) binding to the radioligand \\nPK11195 on positron emission tomography (PET) \\nimaging, are more likely to experience PIRA.51 This \\nobservation suggests that TSPO brain PET ligands \\nare good markers of smouldering MS. A longitudi-\\nnal PET study demonstrated a decrease, but not \\nsuppression, in microglial activation in natalizumab-\\ntreated SPMS patients compared with untreated \\npatients.52 Importantly, this decrease was associated \\nwith slower disability progression during 4 years of \\nfollow-up.52 This implies that trafficking of periph-\\neral immune cells into the CNS contributes to, but \\ndoes not drive, smouldering MS.\\nIt remains to be established if pharmacologically \\nreducing microglial activation will translate into \\nimproved long-term outcomes with established \\nDMTs.

Even among patients with a high \\nnumber of early relapses (⩾3) within the first \\n2 years of the disease, a proportion can experience \\na mild disease course in the long term. 93 Further \\nevidence of a disconnect between the occurrence \\nof relapses and late disability is provided by long-\\nterm follow-up studies of patient cohorts in piv-\\notal DMT clinical trials. Despite treatment of \\npatients with interferon-beta (evident-disease \\nactivity), a larger number of early relapses was \\nassociated with poor long-term outcomes; in con-\\ntrast, in subjects initially randomised to placebo, \\nthe frequency of early attacks had no predictive \\nvalue.94 Similarly, in a large real-world data set  \\nof 2,466 patients followed for at least 10 years,  \\non-therapy relapses carried greater weight than \\noff-therapy relapses in predicting disability pro-\\ngression.95 If focal inflammation detected clini-\\ncally as relapses or radiologically as new lesions \\nwere the primary driver of the MS progression, \\nthen inflammatory attacks and MRI activity would \\nbe expected to predict long-term outcomes both \\nin untreated patients and in those on a DMT.\\nBy applying Prentice Criteria for a surrogate end-\\npoint96 (see Table 2) and deductive reasoning, \\nrelapses and/or focal MRI activity cannot be vali-\\ndated as surrogate endpoints for MS progression \\nand are therefore likely to be an epiphenomenon \\nto the pathological processes driving the disease. \\nWe propose that focal inflammation occurs in \\nresponse to the cause of MS; that is, the real dis-\\nease. The focal inflammatory activity (relapses \\nand/or MRI activity) does not predict disability \\noutcomes in untreated people and is frequently \\nreferred to as the clinico-radiological paradox,97 \\nwhile in patients on a DMT, it represents a \\nmarker that the therapy is not affecting the under-\\nlying primary driver of the MS disease process.\\nAnother example of this paradox concerns the \\nrecent observation that patients with increasing \\nocrelizumab exposure have greater levels of B-cell \\ndepletion in their peripheral blood.98 It was shown \\nthat following the administration of ocrelizumab \\n600 mg every 6 months, serum concentrations of the \\ndrug were higher among subjects weighing  < 60 kg \\nand lower among subjects weighing  > 90 kg, com-\\npared with subjects weighing 60–90 kg.98 This dose \\neffect on B-cell depletion was not reflected in the \\nreduction of relapses or of focal lesions on MRI, as \\nall levels of ocrelizumab exposures were associated \\nwith almost complete suppression of focal inflam-\\nmatory activity.

In addition, teriflu-\\nnomide is more effective when used as a second \\nor third-line agent,103 raising the question of \\nwhether its undetermined mode of action targets \\nmechanisms that are downstream of inflamma-\\ntion or the processes driving smouldering MS, for \\nexample, by inhibiting microglial responses.104\\nAdvanced imaging\\nAdvanced imaging techniques, which can be defined \\nas imaging modalities that are not yet available in \\nroutine clinical practice, provide an opportunity to \\nassess the microscopic features of MS. For example, \\npathology studies have shown that low-level chronic \\ninflammatory activity in microglial cells is also pre-\\nsent in normal-appearing white and grey matter.105 \\nThe appearance of clusters of microglia precedes in \\nsome cases the formation of microglial lesions106–109 \\n(see Figure 4). Advanced imaging can be used to \\ninvestigate such changes in the normal-appearing \\nwhite matter (NAWM).\\nWith the use of double inversion recovery (DIR) \\nsequences, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), T1w \\nand T2*w relaxometry, as well as magnetization \\ntransfer (MT) imaging, it has been possible to \\nbetter characterise the presence of diffuse, focal \\nand global damage in both the cortical grey and \\nwhite matter,110 which contributes to the motor \\nand cognitive dysfunction in patients. 111 As \\ndescribed above, PET imaging with radiotracers \\ncan be used to target TSPO, the expression of \\nwhich is associated with the density of activated \\ninnate immune cells in MS. This technique dem-\\nonstrated the presence of activated macrophages \\nand microglia in the NAWM.112,113 Interestingly, \\nPET studies also unveiled critical roles played by \\nthe diffuse activation of innate immune cells in \\nthe slow process of tissue deterioration. Compared \\nwith RRMS, increased activation of macrophages \\nand microglia in the NAWM in SPMS was shown \\nto be significantly associated with disability accu-\\nmulation over time51,114 and with the rate of brain \\natrophy.115 It was also shown to be spatially \\nrelated to microstructural damage.115,116\\nSELs exhibit a paramagnetic rim that is detectable \\nin vivo by phase-contrast and susceptibility-\\nweighted MRI.47,117 These lesions are characterised \\nby chronic axonal loss and ongoing demyelina-\\ntion118 (Figure 4).

SELs with \\niron rims evolve independently of acute blood-\\nbrain barrier breakdown,118 have a lower MTR, \\nincreased radial diffusion,118 are less likely to remy-\\nelinate, and seem to increase the vulnerability of \\nresidual axons to undergo subsequent neurodegen-\\neration.47 Inflammatory mediators in the hypoin-\\ntense lesion rim, such as free radicals or nitric oxide, \\nmay further stimulate a vicious cycle of detrimental \\nsmouldering inflammation and worsening neuro-\\ndegeneration,119 potentially accounting for the \\nchronic disease progression in MS.50\\nAt postmortem, SELs were only found in the \\nbrains of patients who had reached the progressive \\nstage of MS,24 whereas in vivo, SELs can already \\nbe identified in patients in the relapsing stage.47,117 \\nThis suggests that the presence of SELs increases \\nthe risk of transition to progressive MS.\\nThe ultimate consequence of both focal and dif-\\nfuse, and acute and smouldering activity is the loss \\nof brain and spinal cord volume, including specific \\nbrain structures, which relate to both motor and \\ncognitive function and account for disability \\naccrual.

The EDSS is the most commonly \\nused clinical tool, but it is not sufficiently sensitive to \\ndetect subtle changes in disability.123 Moreover, \\nongoing relapses with incomplete recovery can make \\nit difficult to pinpoint the clinical occurrence of pro-\\ngressive accumulation of disability. In addition, the \\nconventional neurological examination is not ade-\\nquate to monitor patients’ deterioration in their daily \\nactivities. By using an engineered glove to measure \\nthe fine motor performance of the fingers, it was \\ndemonstrated that subtle deterioration can occur \\neven in patients with presymptomatic MS or radio-\\nlogically isolated syndrome.124 In line with these \\nobservations, the pooled analysis of the OPERA tri-\\nals demonstrated that an impressively large propor-\\ntion of patients, in both the ocrelizumab- and \\ninterferon-beta-1a-treated groups (87% and 78%, \\nrespectively), experienced PIRA (see Figure 1) \\ndespite being relatively early in the disease course \\n(mean duration approximately 6 years). This was \\nhighlighted by using a composite score, which \\nincluded changes in the timed 25-foot walk \\n(T25FW), the 9-hole peg test (9HPT), or in the \\nEDSS.1 This approach allowed investigators to \\ncharacterise elements of disease progression more \\ncomprehensively, which would most likely have \\nbeen missed on routine neurological examination. \\nOverall, a more thorough assessment of these subtle \\nphysical or cognitive changes during normal activity \\nor under stress might help to better demonstrate the \\nFigure 4.

Similarly, exer-\\ncise and objective gait analysis can be used to detect \\nsubtle gait abnormalities and exercise-induced dete-\\nrioration in mobility.10 Steps are being taken to bet-\\nter capture these subtle changes, examples of which \\ninclude the use of EDSS-plus, which is more sensi-\\ntive to detect worsening in patients with SPMS,125 \\nand of the Overall Response Score (ORS), which is \\nused as a primary outcome measure in some con-\\ntemporary clinical trials investigating putative remy-\\nelination therapies (NCT03222973). Smart devices, \\nsuch as wearables or suites of smartphone applica-\\ntions, can also be used to assess daily functioning.126 \\nThe latter example involves the self-administration \\nof different tasks to assess the impact of MS across \\nmultiple functional domains.\\nActivity trackers and other digital techniques such \\nas ambient measurement systems are a feasible \\nand popular technology for self-monitoring in \\nMS;127 however, the widespread use of devices is \\nhindered by the heterogeneity of measuring tech-\\nniques and algorithms, privacy concerns, and the \\nneed for adaptation specifically to MS.128 Patient-\\nreported outcomes are validated techniques that \\nquantify MS patients’ own experiences of their \\ndisease, addressing several domains (depression, \\nanxiety, fatigue, pain interference, physical func-\\ntion, cognition) and can be easily administered \\ndigitally via apps and software packages.129\\nChanges in cognitive performance can also reflect \\nsmouldering processes in MS to some extent. The \\nevolution of cognitive deterioration, which can occur \\nfrom a very early stage of the disease,130 is weakly \\nassociated with the inflammatory disease activity as \\nmeasured by the accrual of new/enlarging T2w \\nlesions.131,132 By using functional MRI or DTI, it has \\nbeen demonstrated that cognitive impairment is bet-\\nter accounted for by the subtle worsening of grey mat-\\nter pathology, and by network disruption and axonal \\ndegeneration, irrespective of inflammatory changes.133\\nBrain health\\nThere is mounting evidence that many additional \\nfactors that impact brain function and brain health \\ncan potentially exacerbate and interact with \\nsmouldering MS, resulting in more rapid disease \\nworsening. These include lifestyle factors such as \\nlack of exercise,134 poor diet, 135 smoking 136 and \\nexcessive alcohol intake,137 social determinants of \\nFigure 5.

How combination trials \\nare designed and performed will be a challenge for \\nregulators and the wider MS community. For \\nexample, designing studies where the primary out-\\ncome is the recovery of function is proving to be a \\nchallenge with currently available outcome meas-\\nures. Another aspect to be considered is add-on \\nneurorehabilitation to help augment recovery \\nmechanisms by stimulating biological processes \\nsuch as neuroplasticity.142\\nConclusion\\nWe have presented evidence supporting the notion \\nthat MS as a disease entity is not focal inflamma-\\ntion, that is, relapses and focal MRI activity, but a \\nmore diffuse smouldering pathological process \\nthat affects the entire CNS. We therefore need to \\ngo beyond no evident inflammatory disease activ-\\nity (NEIDA) and focus on other pathological pro-\\ncesses in the end-organ (brain and spinal cord) in \\norder to delay or prevent the slow loss of neuro-\\nlogical function in people with MS. In addition, a \\nholistic approach to the management of MS is \\nneeded by targeting other processes that have \\nbeen shown to impact on brain health.\\nAuthor contributions\\nGavin Giovannoni: Conceptualization; Writing \\n– original draft.\\nVeronica Popescu: Conceptualization; Writing \\n– review & editing.\\nJens Wuerfel: Conceptualization; Writing – \\nreview & editing.\\nKerstin Hellwig: Conceptualization; Writing – \\nreview & editing.\\nEllen Iacobaeus: Conceptualization; Writing – \\nreview & editing.\\nMichael B.
